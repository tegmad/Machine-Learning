       "[\"I understand that adapting a cartoon series scene by scene into a live adaptation is impractical. However, removing the lead character's pivotal arc, which was integral to the essence of the original story, weakens the storytelling. The Aang portrayed lacks the innocence and depth of the 12-year-old protagonist we grew to love; instead, he's presented as a young adult novel archetype warrior.\\n\\nMoreover, the characters seem to lack the comedic traits that defined them, resulting in scenes that feel devoid of emotion and overly somber.\\n\\nThe direction feels stagnant, with characters rigidly placed and delivering exposition rather than engaging dynamically with the world around them.\\n\\nNumerous unnecessary changes detract from the impactful moments, surprising reveals, and character development that made the original series so compelling.\\n\\nWhile I appreciate the efforts put into the visuals and action sequences, they shouldn't be the sole focus of a production with such a substantial budget.\",\n",
       " \"I'm too exhausted with these pointless live action remakes of animated classics to get angry anymore. This Netflix redo of AVATAR: THE LAST AIRBENDER is at best competent, with handsome production design and costuming. Storywise, it strips out the humor of the original, leaving us with grim imitations of the characters we so loved. The sadsack reimagining of the feisty Katara is particularly horrid.\\n\\nThe acting is spotty. Some of the performers are pretty good, but so many of the line readings come off like community theater. Where's the passion?\\n\\nWhile not the fiasco the previous live action feature was, this new AVATAR is just pointless. Yeah it's not bad, but why settle for not bad when the original show was great? I'd rather just rewatch the old one for the hundredth time.\",\n",
       " 'At long last, Netflix\\'s Avatar: The Last Airbender has arrived. And I must say, I didn\\'t necessarily care for it too much. This calls for the classic line: If it ain\\'t broke, don\\'t try to fix it.\\n\\nI wasn\\'t swayed one way or the other. I didn\\'t hate it, but I didn\\'t love it. It kind of just exists. I couldn\\'t help but compare everything in the show to the original cartoon. (One of the best TV shows ever in my book.) Everything was done in its shadow.\\n\\nAt one point I was watching with my brothers and we were like \"this is kind of mid. We should just watch the cartoon.\" And that\\'s what we did. I think that tells you all you need to know.\\n\\nI heard someone say that this was on par with Disney\\'s recent live action remakes. Mostly soulless remakes. And I would have to agree.\\n\\nThe best part of this show is the casting I would say. The acting is just ok though.\\n\\nOverall, I didn\\'t care too much for it.',\n",
       " 'I really loved the animated Series of Avatar, watched it so many times.\\n\\nGood things : Although this season is much better than last flop movie but they missed so many things. CGI is much better, effects and fights are really good. Bending effects couldnt be better .\\n\\nBad things : The fun of characters was nowhere to be seen. Sokka was suppose to be a funny guy but they made him look so angry all the time. Same goes for bhoomi and Iroh.\\n\\nStory has been changed much enough that for person who never watched it wouldnt understand all of it.\\n\\nDialogues and script is so cringe at some places. Specially dialogues of kitara and sokka. Unnecessarily trying to fit the dialogues of animated series without setting up the whole script .\\n\\nSo its 6/10 for me.',\n",
       " \"I know Avatar: The Last Airbender is one of the most popular and loved animated shows of all time. They even tried to make a movie about it back in 2010 the is universally panned. The animated series has a 9.4 rating here and the movie only a 4.0 so people have been hungry for a good live adaptation of the animated series for a long time. It's finally here. It's almost impossible to please everyone who liked the original animated series because everyone has their own expectations on how it should be and they hate when it differs even a little from the original. They don't seem to understand how they don't have the luxury of having unlimited episodes and get go as in depth as the original, it has to be adapted into only 8 episodes per season. I had no problem at all, I liked this series so much that I binged all 8 episodes in only 2 days. I just couldn't stop watching and already looking forward to next season.\",\n",
       " 'As a longtime fan of \"Avatar: The Last Airbender,\" I approached Netflix\\'s adaptation with cautious optimism. Unfortunately, what I found was a series that fell short of capturing the magic and depth of the original.\\n\\nOne of the most glaring issues was the lackluster dialogue. Lines that were iconic in the original series were either altered beyond recognition or delivered with a lack of emotion. For example, the pivotal moment when Aang emerges from the iceberg and speaks to Katara lacked the sincerity and charm that made the scene memorable. Instead of the heartfelt exchange between two characters meeting for the first time, it felt forced and flat.\\n\\nAang: \"I need to ask you something. Please, come closer.\" Katara: \"What is it?\" Aang: \"Will you go penguin sledding with me?\"\\n\\nMoreover, the adaptation failed to capture the essence of the characters. Aang, Katara, and Sokka lacked the depth and development that made them so beloved in the original series. Instead of complex and nuanced personalities, they felt one-dimensional and uninspired.\\n\\nOverall, Netflix\\'s adaptation of \"Avatar: The Last Airbender\" missed the mark. While the visual effects were impressive and the production value was high, it ultimately failed to capture the heart and soul of the original series. Fans of the original will likely be disappointed by this lackluster adaptation.\\n\\nRating: 6/10.',\n",
       " \"No misunderstanding, I'm loving the latest Netflix live action series. I've really liked One Piece, Yu-Yu Hakusho and Avatar, and I finally see that things are being done right.\\n\\nThe issue with Avatar is another: it's born from a cult series that is very difficult to fill. On the one hand, it has effects that are sometimes very noticeable in terms of green screens. On the other hand, between chapter 3 and 6, so many stories are mixed together that it's a literal mess. We have a good cast, but perhaps the weakest point is Ang himself during some moments. Chapter 2 was a delight, I really liked 7 and 8. It feels like there isn't as much chemistry between the main trio and perhaps the Ang-Katara ship wasn't seen at all during this season. The best thing for me is the Zuko and Ioh plot that develops very well. Well, that's why the title of my review: given the original material, it can and should give more...I look forward to the next seasons.\",\n",
       " \"Avatar: The Last Airbender is based off the animated series of the same name. It takes place in a world that is divided into 4 different nations, each nation is made up of an element (Fire, Water, Air and Earth). The Avatar is the only one who can master all 4 elements and the one who brings balance between all the nations until one day the Fire Nation decides to invade. The Avatar is the only one who can stop them but he suddenly disappears. A hundred years later a new Avatar named, Aang, emerges. With some help from friends he must master the elements to bring peace and balance back to the world. I have to admit that I've never seen the animated series or movie so I went into this with no expectations or prior knowledge of the series. I've read good things and the trailer looked good so I gave it a shot. I'm glad I did because I really enjoyed it. I thought it was going to be more aimed to younger audiences but it's enjoyable for everyone.\",\n",
       " 'First things first, they did a top notch job with visual effects. Bending techniques, the way the elements connect with the bodies of the characters, the places all look wonderful. They bring the world alive. However, that is not what ATLA is about. In order for the characters to have their development we need to see their interaction, we need to see their characters, that is why we love the characters in the cartoon. Here the characters are all over the place. There is no goofiness, they are all too serious which bothers.\\n\\nAlso, showing things subtly, inserting the message between the lines is the strength of the cartoon. Here they deliver ling winded, empty, and bland speeches that do not move us.',\n",
       " 'Overall i enjoyed the show. The visual FX is a spectacle to watch and is rather nicely executed. The backdrops and sets were all very well done. The characters themselves give tribute the original story and characters but that is there my problems with the show begins.\\n\\nMy biggest disappointment is that If you\\'ve watched the movie you could basically can skip this. The general story begins and ends the same.\\n\\nThe writing at times felt forced, bland and \"kinda pausing for reaction\" bad. The actors themselves i liked, but nothing memorable either.\\n\\nThe princess character and here entourage annoyed me to no end and the whole writing around her felt extremely forced. And while writing this part or this review I even lower my score from 7 to 6/10 so bad it was for me.',\n",
       " 'I saw many episodes of the first season of the cartoon, but not all. Back when there were no streaming services so I needed to watch it on television when I passed by chaning the channels. Through the years I got parts of the first story but never the last episode of season 1. So I am aware of the story.\\n\\nI also saw the movie or movies, I am not sure how many there are. Het last one was not bad, it looks like this series. So I see the battle in the north again. But I must say, it was no problem. This series is very watchable. Sometimes you have amazing shots. But overall you can see the background faded and the foreground sharp and too much light, so you see it is fake. I think the really big amazing shots cost a lot of money and even that the other scens looking fake, it is still of a high quality. I think it is also combined with real shots.\\n\\nI mostly like the characters, but many times I think: there is something off. Like the parents or the crazy king. Also the acting can be a bit off, like it is too static. Just like the fake backgrounds. It looks to clinical.\\n\\nBut overall I believe the characters. The most important characters are believable for me. It also sometimes has the same sillynes as the original. The pace is also good, but I think sometimes it is going too fast. I think they take some shortcuts, but overall you get the main story. I enjoyed watching this. I am starting watching the original again, but then from season 2.\\n\\nSo I think there should be a season 2. I do not know if I like it after I just saw the original. But I saw many horrible adapation of books, games and animation. This is a very good take. It can be a bit better, bit more clever maybe. But this is solid.',\n",
       " \"Amazing scenary and editing, it really gives off the vibe of the places in the original series. Also the didn't spare in the usage of bending which is great.\\n\\nBut i was thrown a bit off by the threatical like acting, and the script. Maybe I need to get used to it. But it feels a bit forced how they act, like is very improbable to behave like that in reality. I guess they try to have similar reactions as the original characters in the show, but since they are cartoons its more acceptable. For a live action adaptation i would expect a bit more real/normal behaviour. But then again, i only watched one episode so far, so I'll try to get use to it.\",\n",
       " \"The visuals are stunning - the effects are more impressive than I hoped. Unfortunately the dialogue leaves very little to the imagination. It is so literal! Good storytelling doesn't involve explaining to the audience the beginning middle and end in the first 20 minutes. Did Chat-GPT write this?! This reeks of studio execs having to get this out and not hiring/ supporting good writers. It cheapens the acting, and you lose the emotion, passion, and energy. The animated show wasn't about the sick fight scenes, but that's likely all you're gonna get from the live action.\\n\\nKid who plays Zuko absolutely nails it. He couldn't have been cast better.\",\n",
       " \"Absolutely loved Avatar The Last Airbender on Netflix! I was glued to it. The actors are remarkable and the story is captivating and exciting. Although I personally felt that episode 5 and 6 could have been better visually, overall it was really good show. A must watch series! I can't wait for season 2 & 3 to come out and see where it takes Aang and his friends next on the journey. Their friendship is so beautifully portrayed and the show transforms you into Aang's world and you can truly relate to most of the characters. I loved the vibrant special effects and VFX. It is truly a well made show. It definitely needs to be marketed more. I noticed the show a few months after its release.\",\n",
       " \"First (1), the best arc that set the bar high in acting, casting, look and feel, storytelling, direction for Avatar is the Kyoshi Island arc (episode 2). They definitely got that right, 9.5/10. BRAVO! Whoever was involved there, give them a raise!! The worst and most disappointing arc was the Omashu arc (episode 3). They tried to do too much in one episode, it seemed rushed, as a result, it was just a mess, 4/10. I almost gave up watching the rest of the show because of episode 3. It was like the director, scriptwriters, editors took the day off. Should have just concentrated on a favorite arc and run upwards with it (my preferred would have been a way better King Bumi arc, drop the Jet, Teo and badger mole arcs). Or give them entire episodes each. I repeat, episode 3 was a mess, very disappointing. Second (2), everywhere else (that is not the Kyoshi island arc), the acting still needs a lot of improvement (which means the director needs to step up as well and bring it out of the actors). I rate the acting as follows: Aang (6), Katara (6) lacks emotion, Sokka (6) needs to be funnier/goofyer, Azula, Sozin, Ozai (5), Iroh (6). I think these actors did a way better job in portraying their characters: June (8), Zhao (8.5), Zuko (8.5), Avatar Kyoshi (9), Suki (9), Yukari (9). Third (3), the characters as they were presented have too many flaws. Azula is too weak rather than scary/powerful or frightening/intimidating. Maybe she could have played the part Toph better, but needs to act tougher. The old movie had a better Azula. The actress who played June (bounty hunter) would have made a way better Azula. Sozin was too friendly looking, doesn't look like anyone who wants to conqueror anything. Ozai though they got the look right didn't appear scary and overpowering/intimidating/bent on conquest. Mai and Tylee - almost invisible. Would have preferred more airtime and character development of them rather than Jet and Teo arc mess of episode 3. Fourth (4), the Northern Water Tribe arc, I thought it was just OK, the storytelling of animated version was just way better. The actors for Yue and Pakku, I think they did a good job, 7 each. Overall, I give the live action season a 7/10. Will watch season 2.\",\n",

The first few minutes were really B grade but it got much better and I ended up watching all episodes over two days. I loved the little kid who played Aang, and the two who played Katara and Sokka. Prince Zuko was also good. It was great to see so many Native Americans in the story. I will eagerly await season 2, which didn't expect when I started watching it. If you want a straight forward fantasy filled story with great special effects, with no mind bending underlying themes, this one can be recommended.\",\n",

But he does portray his innocence well and his acting is good for someone in his technically first role. Dallas (Zuko ) and Ian (Sokka ) were the real standouts\\n\\nThe production, in terms of cgi , sets and bending was overall really good. When Aang goes into the avatar state it generally does look kinda scary in a way. The fight scenes were prob my fav part , they do a great job at handling them , and I really that they did a fight scene that didn't really feature much bending between 2 powerful benders\\n\\nThere is actually a lot of changes , some I might not like but i 100% get or just others I might have to fully understand on a rewatch\\n\\nBut even tho it's def more serious then the original there's still some of that innocence of the original's\\n\\nI'll say this tho , just give it a shot and come in with an open mind . If u come in expecting a straight 1 of 1, or for it to be as good as the original , then ur not gunna like it. I've seen some reviews where it's just getting compared to the original, which wouldn't really be that fair since the original is perfection to many ppl and others where u can tell ppl are just upset that it's not a 1 of 1.

However, most of the time the actors really try, some come out better, some worse. The choice of actors for the roles is very good, almost all of them fit their roles, there are exceptions such as Princess Yue, Mai and King Bumi who to me do not fit the look of the characters.\\n\\nPlot changes obviously had to happen and it's understandable because how would they pack over 20 episodes into 8? Some of the changes look cool and don't really bother me. However, most of the changes surprise me a lot. The solution from the original would have looked much better and would have made more sense. Because of these changes, many of the characters are just different and do not reflect their character from the animation.\\n\\nWhy do they tell us everything? What? What for? Why? How? Instead of showing the character's emotions, what motivates them, what their intentions are, what they are afraid of, they tell it all to the camera.

Some of the acting is clunky and a bit goofy; however, watching the character dynamics with each other is, quite honestly, as close to the source that could be expected. Firebenders manifest fire. Waterbenders look like waterbenders. This can be watched, and you can still reminisce the animated adventure without feeling an injustice has been committed like a past adaptation that won't be mentioned here.......ever again........personally, I don't hover over films, shows, or media in general looking for inconsistencies. But as a causal viewer. This is perfectly imperfect. It captures the world of Avatar. I'm relieved of the dread of expecting some artist's COMPLETE reimagining of a beloved source and elated to find something that is a retelling of it in a different medium. True to the source; true to the story. I appreciate this beyond words, and am excited to see it through.\",\n",
       " \"I am very loyal to the original animated series, and I understand why the creators of the original series decided to part ways on this adaptation. I was so angry when I started this, so many plot points and characters were mushed together to fit into less episodes that it left out huge development details, huge connections that become critical later in the storyline, and above all else, Aang's story felt nothing like him. But then I switched perspectives, and made Zuko the main character in my head... and the whole thing changed. I was no longer mad about what was wrong with Aang's story because it was not the necessary to the main characters plot. I was still very annoyed... but I wasn't fuming and yelling at the TV (which I did, more than once). Is the original better? Hands down! But anyone who has seen the original should have already been prepared, knowing nothing will be better than what we all already loved. But because of how well the original handled character development, we all love Zuko just as much as we love Aang. So try watching it as if this is his story, it may make it easier for you to enjoy. Do I think this series can and should do better in the future at staying truer to the original plot? Absolutely. I am hoping they had to combine plot points in this season to get the show off the ground and get a bigger budget from Netflix on season two, and with a larger budget will stay truer to the story. I think it is worth watching, if only to see certain aspects come to life in live action. Just know there are parts you will be mad about. And give it a chance with Zuko in mind as the star.\",\n",

And it just grew each episode.\\n\\nI had to let go of some of the things we all deeply love about the original, but most of that was due to the live action medium versus animated.

       " 'The original Avatar the last Airbender series is one of my favorites of all time. I remember watching it live week to week as a high schooler and thinking how weird it was I was so into a \"kids show\" on Nickelodeon. As I get older I\\'ve watched it a few more times and the more I watch it, the more I love it. It holds up in every aspect-the visuals, writing, character arcs and relationships amongst each other, humor, etc.\\n\\nSo when this show was announced I was skeptical because the movie stunk, and because the original series makes it a lot to live up to. I\\'ve now watched the whole first season and I have to say it exceeded my low expectations. As others have said, the visuals are incredible and some of the casting is actually very much on point. I thought Yue, Iroh, Zhao and Zuko in particular were all pretty great (However, other casting decisions were not good at all, but that wasn\\'t my main problem that I\\'ll get to later). I appreciated that they didn\\'t veer too far off the path of the first one in terms of plot (although they did rearrange some things that I thought were unnecessary and skipped some story sections I liked). Keep sticking to the source material in the future seasons!\\n\\nThe thing I think they missed on big time though, and hope to see changed in the coming seasons, is the brightness, levity, and humor of the original series. The first one walked the line really well of portraying at times very mature themes, but packaged them in a way that was very digestible and often times funny. The remake ditched that strategy almost completely, and the tone is over the top serious and at times even dark. I really couldn\\'t specifically believe how they portrayed Aang and Sokka as mostly serious characters, it felt wrong. They\\'re both kids, they don\\'t need to force them to act like adults, it\\'s weird. To add to that, Katara is portrayed timid this time, when in the original she was feisty and the voice of reason to two goofballs.\\n\\nIf you watch the original for just one episode after watching the live action version you see how radical the tone shift is, and I hope they don\\'t keep going in this direction, it could be so much better with a brighter and funnier tone, one that doesn\\'t take itself so seriously but still can tackle mature themes.

As a huge fan of the original, I would have rather they just cut storyline in order for it to make sense and move more fluidly.\\n\\nAlso, I felt the heavy reliance on CGI was more about flexing the budget and less about being accurate to the source material. I would have loved to see more material sets.\\n\\nI wanted more time with Aang, Katara, and Sokka initially so we can get to know and love them as we did in the original series. They feel like strangers in this series and that's sad to me. Also, not hating on the actress, but Katara's character is completely different. I'm not sure why that choice was made. I miss the original character.\\n\\nIt's worth watching, but I'm not going to be showing this to anyone in place of the original show. I hope if they make a season 2, they take notes.\",\n",

The whole point of his journey is accepting responsibility and that begins with running away!\\n\\nAang's character is told through other people instead of him being it.

Not only did they remove the Aang's breakdown from a scene, but they also made him look like someone who is afraid of taking responsibility and just wants to play games. What was important to him here was not playing games, but his friends. I still don't understand how you completely deleted these emotional things. I don't understand why they changed a perfect script. If you want something more mature and something that have humor, different emotions, watch the original.

There are even people who criticized the series even before its release due to the disastrous series that was released in 2010. On my part as a fan of the Avatar The Legend of Aang series, I can say that I very much enjoyed this show, starting with the story that They kept it with a few minor changes, in addition to the wonderful acting of the characters. I loved the character of Aang and how he balanced being a child who wanted to play but carrying responsibility for the world at the same time. I also liked the character of Zuko, his story, his motivations, and his constant struggle to find the Avatar to restore his inheritance to rule. I also liked the change that occurred at Saka's character from what it was in the original series, from a funny character to a domineering character with a painful past and a feeling of letting his father down. The series gave each character its due and gave them enough depth that made us relate to them, in addition to the smooth progression in the story without there being an exaggerated prolongation of events with development with very distinctive and noticeable for the characters, and I also respected the preservation of the atmosphere of mystery and wisdom characteristic of the original series with perfect photography and very excellent CGI. Perhaps there are a few things that I did not like, such as Aang's weak acting in sad moments and the previous Avatars not giving any development to Aang's character. In fact, I think this series is one of the most underrated series in this year because it carries the name and legacy of a great series that created most of young people's childhoods and an audience that looks forward to an iconic work like it, and I expect the second part to be better than the first.\",\n",

The best parts of it were when the live action show did its own thing, and the worst parts were the references to the original. Some of the acting is good, some of it isn't. I think it's a fun fantasy show but as a live action remake of the legendary masterpiece it's alright. However, a lot of my complaints could be improved in the second season if they get greenlight. The weaker acting is mostly the child actors who are inexperienced. With more experience they could improve. Also, too much exposition, but in the second season it would be less necessary for new fans so they would cut it out. The pacing could be improved with more than 8 episodes, I think having at least 10 episodes could help the show. Certainly in Hollywood these 5-10 episode hour long movie like shows are not helping anyone. Not the production team or the audience. It's definitely an improvement from the movie, but for sure flawed.\",\n",

We love the original too much, it's just an impossible standard to keep up with.\\n\\nThis adaptation is no exception. It doesn't 'quite' live up to its source material. But there are still things to love about it.\\n\\nThe stunning cgi being one of them. The bending looks super cool. We all remember how it took like four earth benders to lift a single rock in the Shyamalan movie, which was laughable. In this adaptation, they're just as skilled with their elements as in the original. I appreciate that. Overall, it's an aesthetically pleasing series.\\n\\nI do agree with some of the other reviewers in regard to the acting, however. Some of the actors come across as a little inexperienced, especially in the pilot.\\n\\nBut in their defence, I think the script sort of makes it difficult for them. Some of the dialogue falls flat, even when it's supposed to be super impactful and dramatic. Plenty of telling-instead-of-showing. It gets a little weird at times. Especially when some of the scenes lack a background soundtrack, so it's just them having straight-to-the-point conversations to the sound of wind. (This, too, got better after that first episode.)\\n\\nAnd despite the acting perhaps lacking every now and again, I think they managed to stay much truer to the original characters this time around, which I'm so happy about. Sokka is so much funnier and wittier than in the movie. I actually RECOGNISE him. :) Same goes for Aang. He's a lot better here than in the movie - brighter, happier, more prone to jokes. It's so great to see, after the super stern Sokka and very serious Aang in Shyamalan's version.\\n\\nI think they cast a really good Zuko, too! One of the best actors in the show, hands down.\\n\\n(The actress playing Katara could do with showing a bit more emotion though. Katara was always very expressive - here, she just sort of 'barely' reacts to what's going on around her, with only a few exceptions.)\\n\\nUnfortunately, episode 1 didn't make a great first impression, but I really urge you to give episode 2 a try. :)\",\n",

Visuals are stunning and the cast are all so fitting, some of the acting is questionable but for kids that haven't had a whole lot of experience in the industry, they didn't make me cringe, so in my eyes that's decent enough and forgivable. (They're much better than the Harry Potter kids when they first started out.) The fighting scenes are all amazing and makes bending look so powerful and devastating, really enjoyable. Most definitely doesn't deserve the 1 star that some of the reviewers have given it, it's a million times better than that movie that shall not be named and watching it brought a nostalgic tear to my eye.

It feels closer to being a literal explanation of the plot, rather than an entertaining journey of discovery/character growth. Whether it was a conscious decision to water down the storytelling, or a failure of writing, is up for debate.\\n\\nIn the first half of the series, the acting is wooden and the pace is rushed. It's structured more like a series of short stories, making it difficult to get truly engrossed. The second half definitely picks things up, particularly the last couple of episodes. There are a few sweet moments which capture some of the innocence of the original. The effects are also excellent throughout, especially in the fight scenes.\\n\\nWhilst the story telling is somewhat disappointing, and the dialogue is definitely oversimplified/literal, there's enough here to make it a fun watch.

They cram in cheap scenes between Monk Gyatso and Aang; chop and mix up the reunion sequence with King Bumi and the Gaang; expunge developed habits like Katara's motherly nagging and Sokka's negative thinking; rewrite Azula, the controlling psychopathic princess, as a victim; politicize an ancient Earth Kingdom legend; reveal Ozai's Angels and Fire Lord Ozai himself a bit early; cut out playful scenes like elephant koi and penguin riding; delete subtleties like Katara's necklace affecting Pakku's arc; swap Aang for Sokka in the Cave of Two Lovers dropping the romance; disclose the significance of the comet, etc.\\n\\nThere is also too much exposition when they could be dramatizing an emotional scene. Which has more impact? Aang is constantly pulled on the opposite ends of destiny and freedom. He plays with his airball buddies, impressing them with tricks, then he's told, at the age of 12, he's the Avatar, and his friends begin to alienate him for it. The council's prediction of a looming threat, demands of high level training, losing his sense of belonging, and increasing obligations upset him, despite Gyatso's futile pampering, and Aang, scared and confused, flees into a storm. A century later, he makes new friends, astonishes them with his water bending, then suffers Katara's unpleasant question on his identity, and as he looks away he hits us with a painful answer, but is happily embraced because of it. Or Aang talks to himself. This is just one example out of many.\\n\\nBy choosing the least creative path, you rob the viewer the chance to think and know, to love and hate, to weep and laugh. A story is always stronger by showing the physical actions and details of your characters. There is no shame in following the superior version; in fact, the adaptation relies on the strength of the original to cut seemingly negligible interactions meant to develop their characters. The animated characters had true undeniable chemistry. We don't witness rapport to that extent in the live-action cast.\\n\\nAaron Ehasz, the head writer, did an excellent job in tidying up Bryan and Michael's original series. By now it should be clear you need people to shut down bad ideas too and Ehasz was that guy. Anyway, there is a lot to nitpick, like the casting choices, ticks like trembling or licking lips and vocal fry, cosplay tier costumes, etc. But I'd leave that to less busier minds.\",\n",
       " 'People hold the new series to a very high standard that the animated series set. Of course, we cant expect that a live action remake identically resembles the animated. Although there are some awkward moments in the script (that I attribute to keeping the characters and script almost too much like the cartoon), this version captures the same energy as the original and the production quality is phenomenal - the CGI is beautiful work, the set designs are intricate. You can certainly see that a large budget was involved. Watching this brings on a huge wave of nostalgia and the characters feel so familiar already as they quite closely resemble the animated characters we love. The music is also true to source material and I think is an underrated component in making the episodes feel authentic. Im excited that we have two more seasons coming up.',\n",

Aang's actor handles the action scenes very well, but his emotional moments and dramatic scenese are just bad. He has a good bit of Aang's free spirit attitude though so that's nice.\\n\\nThe actions sequences, choreography, and cgi is very impressive and looks expensive. Glad they did it right. Gyatso was a terrific casting as well as some of the other choices including Iroh and Prince Zuko. Sokka and Katarra are not bad.\\n\\nOverall, it's something I'm definitely going to finish. As a big fan of the TV show, I was skeptical, particularly after the original showrunners quit due to creative differences, but this has been above average. It's not amazing or anything, but it's solidly good.\",\n",

The special effects have their moments of lesser quality, but for the most part they\\'re quite impressive.\\n\\nIt reminded me why I love the cartoon so much.\\n\\nCons:\\n\\nWhere to start?\\n\\nMuch of the acting is, well, questionable. It strikes me as a directorial problem, as even some of the seasoned actors are awkward and stiff. But give poor direction to kids and you get \\'emotional\\' scenes that you just have to wince your way through.\\n\\nThe structure of the narrative has been chopped to pieces and shuffled around like a deck of cards. Parts of the plot from the middle of the original book 1 are dragged to the beginning. Even more egregious are the elements from book 2- and some as far as book 3- that find themselves being crow barred into the already shortened plot, resulting in a very rushed pacing that barely has room to draw breath. This also robs large parts of the unfolding story of their mystery and impact.\\n\\nThe character arcs are vague at best and absent at worst. Unfortunately, that includes Aang. The innocent, carefree, playful, and jovial boy in the iceberg is not here. Nor are the layers of his fear, trepidation, guilt, and grief.\\n\\nWhether by necessity of the speedy pace or simply a lack of care, the writing leaves much to be desired. It leans very heavily on the \"tell\" half of \"show don\\'t tell\", with swathes of dialogue that in the original was used for character moments and humour, now dedicated to exposition dumps.\\n\\nThe cliff notes feel of the series, combined with a certain lack of polish and attention to detail, somewhat suggests that the creators didn\\'t really understand what made the cartoon so great. It\\'s missing those subtleties that added so much to the breadth of the world, and makes re-watching such a treat when you notice the fragments of foreshadowing you missed last time. Rather than letting the story and stakes rise and expand naturally, it ticks off plot points like a checklist before quickly moving on.\\n\\nI\\'m quite disappointed. It\\'s a hollow but nice to look at shell of the cartoon, which I shall be watching again instead of this.',\n",

I myself have watched avatars from the animated series, Korra to some of them reading comics and some short animations.

       " 'It\\'s been a few weeks since this show came out and I\\'ve finally finished it. Since pretty much day one after this came out, I have seen so many videos pop up in my youtube feed criticizing the show, saying how dumb it is, ranking all the worst parts, etc. It kind of blew my mind how it seemed like everybody was just immediately ready to tear it to shreds, so I went into it with some trepidation, but still cautiously excited. Now that I\\'ve finished, I think most of the people who are extremely critical really had unrealistic expectations. And maybe I would have felt the same if I hadn\\'t tempered my own expectations before watching it, since I recently rewatched the original, so it\\'s fresh in my mind. Now that I\\'ve finished this new take on it, overall I really enjoyed it a lot! I\\'m very excited for the next two seasons.\\n\\nThis show isn\\'t perfect, the biggest issue is that Katara is not nearly as fierce as in the original. A lot of people have already mentioned her somewhat emotionless portrayal here, and that\\'s hard to deny. I did see a video of Kiawentiio\\'s original audition tape for the part, and I completely see why they cast her. I\\'m not sure what happened between then and filming, but I doubt it\\'s entirely her fault and I have hope that they can remedy this in later seasons.\\n\\nOther than that, I felt like all the other cast members really fit their characters impressively well. I thought Aang was great, he was able to be serious when that was called for but was still a fun-loving kid like in the original. Ozai was crazy intimidating, Zhao was delightfully slimy, Uncle Iroh was such a sweetheart. I was kind of amazed how perfect Sokka\\'s casting was, he even sounds like the original actor. I hope they add some more humorous moments for him in the future, or at least make his comical moments more funny. I understand that this medium has less comedy potential and I wasn\\'t expecting it to nearly measure up to the original, but given how absolutely brilliant the writing for the original Sokka was, I hope they can step it up at least a bit for him in later seasons. I was still pretty satisfied with how he was in this version given the overall different tone, but Sokka was my favorite character in the original and he wasn\\'t even a contender for my favorite here. But that\\'s mostly because of my absolute favorite part of this adaptation... I\\'m lowkey obsessed with this version of Prince Zuko. Every scene with him in it is a highlight. The best episodes were the ones with more of him and his backstory. His action scenes are extremely cool, his acting is very nuanced and full of emotion, his backstory is fleshed out even more than the original, his relationship with Uncle Iroh made me feel so much emotion and brought me to tears more than once. I will admit, when I first saw the trailer I was thinking, \"this guy doesn\\'t look like the original Zuko, I\\'m disappointed.\" But after actually seeing him in action, I take back that thought. He\\'s absolutely the best thing in the show and it\\'s not even close. I love that in this version, you get to see more clearly early on in the show that Zuko really is a good guy with such a good heart, and literally everything bad about him came from his evil, abusive father. He was already one of the best written characters I\\'ve ever seen, with the absolute best redemption arc I\\'ve ever seen, and they did him justice here.\\n\\nSo, bottom line is, you should give this show a fair chance and enjoy it without comparing it too harshly with the original.\\n\\nAlso Dallas Liu\\'s performance is worth like 5 of the stars I gave the show haha.',\n",

Most of the Avatar audience, imo, have \"grown up\" by now but they still made a few casting choices that are for, well, the younger audience.\\n\\nI didn\\'t grow up watching the cartoon but I did find it and Korra about 6 years ago and absolutely LOVE the cartoons. So, going into this I was skeptical and hopeful. Imo, they delivered. This version does feel like a live action of the cartoon we all love. The feel of this is great. The CGI is absolutely awesome! Sokka, lmao, that was spot on casting. Same with Aang. Most of the acting and casting is really good. Katara, imo, falls a little short. Her acting is pretty dry tbh. It gets better at times and during others you can really feel her lack of experience.\\n\\nDon\\'t get me wrong guys, this isn\\'t perfect. There are things to be nit picky about. But, comparing this to other failed live-actions, or live actions where they took their own liberties with it, this one feels like Netflix stayed true to the source material and I thank you for that!

It was impressive how they took characters and plot points from different episodes and weaved them together. But then people hate on it for not mindlessly sticking to a 1:1 replica of the cartoon.\\n\\nHonestly this show looks awesome, the sets, the colours, it\\'s absolutely magnificent. The action scenes are epic in terms of fight choreography and the cgi for the bending is highly impressive.\\n\\nRegarding the script. Sure there\\'s occasional weak lines- eg Katara telling Jet \"You are the bad guy\" and too many mentions of \"we need to save the world\". But overall the dialogue is pretty good. There\\'s even some beautifully written dialogue in scenes which didn\\'t exist in the original. Or perhaps there\\'s a slightly different interpretation of a certain characters mindset and i was often impressed with the writing.\\n\\nPeople say the humour and charm are gone but they\\'re wrong. They writers have created a fairly serious/dramatic live-action, but there\\'s still a colourful vibe and some funny/wholesome moments dispersed throughout episodes. People complaining that Aang is too mature......eh it\\'s kinda a weak criticism tbh. He is mature but he often has this childlike glowing look of excitement. I like how much energy his actor brings to the role even if occasionally it feels a bit forced.\\n\\nI\\'m often fairly critical of most modern shows tbh, but i actually had pretty high expectations because this is a valuable and beloved series. Episode 1 was a little wobbly for me in terms of storytelling and acting, but once i got into episodes 2 and 3 my high expectations were met and sustained till the end.\\n\\nI\\'m happy that we have this series which takes some creative liberty, while also being faithful to the spirit and message of the original cartoon.\\n\\nIf the writers are reading this, go ahead and be as creative as you want about how to tell the story in season 2.

The writing in general is faithful to the original but the creators also make adjustments to compliment the transition to live-action; honestly, if it was a 100% recreation I don't think it could work. The tone is slightly heavier in this series, so yes some of Aang's childishness is lost, but I'm liking it.\\n\\nOverall: great show.

Not just the animals and bending but scenery and bigger things looked very good.\\n\\nThe casting, I think, was very well done. Every character reminded me closely of the animated characters and outshines the movie we don't talk about in any way.\\n\\nThe costumes and scenery were very detailed but you could also see where the production reached limits. That's fine, as I said, it should not be a mirror.\\n\\nOne flaw for me was the acting, especially of Ian Ousley who portrays Sokka. I think he was not given enough Charakter depth which is a shame because Sokka is a character that leads through the story when others are less able to. I missed depth in general but in the case of Sokka it really bothered me.\\n\\nOverall, I think this is a great adaption and I'm looking forward to the next series.\",\n",

The firebenders in particular bring a shocking brutality to a world which has been at war for a hundred years. Not for kids in that respect.\\n\\nIf one is expecting a cartoon, watch the original which is truly a work of art. The whimsy and joy of it can\\'t be recreated in a story that tries to show us a real world version.\\n\\nI will say that even though so much was well done and involved, a lot felt rushed. This effort tried to take a 20-episode \"book\", and pack it into 8, and while I admit, that there were some areas in which this kind of editing won\\'t show in the long run, it does feel like it\\'s being pushed along too quickly.\\n\\nAs far as the cast goes, there are some brilliant spots, particularly in the adult performances, and the kids don\\'t do too badly for the most part. That said, I think more care could have been taken with casting to better match the characters, not necessarily in looks but in individuality. There\\'s not a whole lot of \"x-factor\" there. Aang and Sokka are bright spots, but the rest of the cast looks like they\\'re interchangeable. Hopefully, they\\'ll improve over time.\\n\\nThere was one other weird, noticeable thing to mention. The costumes are incredibly clever - but way too clean. Possibly some sort of deliberate homage to the cartoon? The hairstyles for Gran Gran and Yue are unbelievably unrealistic and Sokka\\'s necklace makes him look like Pebbles Flintstone, so one wonders if these are cartoon affectations. The sets themselves bring us back to familiar territory, as do occasional bits of dialogue.\\n\\nOverall, this was an enjoyable series. I hope it\\'s continued.',\n",

That way they could have improved the story and it wouldn't have felt rushed. The best thing about the series is the cinematography, the effects and of course the bending. The serious tone of the series gives the war a certain weight, which is interesting for the worldbuilding.

I love the character of uncle iroh but in the first season it looked kind of angry later in the second and third he was more opened and lovely, in the live action serie it gave him his lovely personality since the begging so I appreciate that.

So if they can get aang to be the goofy kid with extrem strength and make katara more relevant this could be very good. And sokkas character is very good and i like him and his acting alot but i want him too get too say more off his stupid not funny jokes but you laugh eiter whey jokes. So tho conclude it has its flaws but it has alot off posetivs aswell and we all know it can never top the first show but it can still be extremly goooood.\",\n",

While this new show isn't exactly 100% in line with the animated show, it is close enough that you don't really notice it. The SFX aren't too over done to the point of being ridiculous, and the writing was done so that it was able to condense a 20 episode animated season, into 8 episodes and not really miss anything (unlike how the movie did..).

I'd be bored if it was the exact same story. It's 80% the same, 20% new, and 100% faithful.

I think the OG series will be seen as the true canon still and this series will be seen as the story with less details. Thats the unfortunate part. I love how more people with different tastes can like something that lets people relate with one another no matter their preference in live action or animated.

       " 'I was a huge fan of the animated show as a kid. I even remember when Nickelodeon had first announced that it was a new TV show back in the day. It was one of those once-in-a-lifetime type of cartoons that really sent home a lot of powerful life messages and entertained the young mind in a manner that felt natural - never forced. The caveat to all of this is that there were elements from the show that could only be made possible because of the animation and the incredible performances from the voice actors.\\n\\nNetflix\\'s Avatar: The Last Airbender seeks to rewrite the horrid wrongs made by M. Night Shyamalan\\'s 2010 disastrous adaptation of the source material. I\\'ll start by saying it\\'s not a perfect adaptation - by no means - and the avid fan can see where the source material breaks and sinks with the Netflix film-making formula. The performances from the actors all vary - some incredibly great - some not so good - but not terrible either. The story flows as well as it can - adapted from an animated show to a real life one.\\n\\nI think Gordon Cormier\\'s performance as Aang was good and felt very in-line with how the original character was depicted. There were parts where I think he could\\'ve improved upon, but overall, I think the actor did a decent job for the script he had been given.\\n\\nKiawentiio Tarbell\\'s Katara felt less relatable than with the animated version of the character. I felt like there were some lines that fell flat, emotionless, and otherwise uncaring for the situation at hand. I think the performance improved as the show started to draw to a close, but I wouldn\\'t say it\\'s a terrible performance either.\\n\\nI thought Ian Ousley\\'s performance as Sokka was incredibly good for how I remember the character. I think there were limits to how \"animated\" he could get without it becoming cringe or too cartoonish in a live-action, but for the spirit of who Sokka was in the animated show, Ian did a decent job channeling it here.\\n\\nMy favorite performances ultimately came from Dallas James Liu\\'s Zuko and Paul Sun-Hyung Lee\\'s Uncle Iroh. While nobody can beat the original performances by Dante Basco and Mako/Greg Baldwin respectively, I think those two were a powerhouse duo throughout the show. The character arc that Zuko had felt so impactful and highlighted Zuko\\'s true honorable nature throughout and Iroh\\'s great care for his nephew mirroring his own personal struggle of his own loss was really nice too.\\n\\nAll-in-all, I think it\\'s a pretty good show. I don\\'t think I\\'ll be rewatching it anytime soon - I\\'d rather just rewatch the anime - but it feels like the live adaptation that we should\\'ve gotten over a decade ago. It\\'s not perfect, but I\\'d venture to say that it\\'s good enough and I hope that some of the critique they get from this first season helps them refine a better second season.',\n",

Besides all other side storylines don't go together. It's all just a mix up of the occuring events of the original series. I could just watch it until episode 4 before it was too boring to go on.\",\n",

Soka, I felt that his love was really powerful, you saw the strong connection between him and Suki. Katara her power was real, but I didn't see her kindness and how naive she was, now you see more of her cunning and her strength instead of it coming in later.

I believe it is the story that will bring this series forward rather than its visuals and acting. Not saying that the visuals here are bad, it's also well done. The action sequences are also good for a series. I heard the actors/actresses did a workshop on tai chi and wu shu before filming. Explains how their movements are not sloppy. The characters, well, they could have used a more appealing Azula. Overall, this series is on the likable side.\",\n",

It's still all expositional but he makes it work or does his best with it.\\n\\nWhere's the humor?

However, the storyline does feel rushed. It's understandable that recreating over 60 episodes of 20 minutes without slacking on the effects is difficult. So I do hope this season opens a window to create a bigger budget for the next season. A few episodes more to add more to the story and seeing Aang more as the main character.

It\\'s like watching a behind-the-scenes featurette accidentally spliced into the final cut.\\n\\nThe characters themselves are a curious bunch. While the writing gives them a solid foundation, some of the portrayals, particularly Aang\\'s, haven\\'t quite mastered the art of emotional connection. Let\\'s just say, their tearbending skills could use some work. In some scenes, it felt like watching a group of talented actors rehearsing rather than fully embodying their roles. It\\'s like attending a play where the actors keep forgetting their lines, but the set design is fantastic.\\n\\nDespite these observations, \"Avatar: The Last Airbender\" (2024-) still manages to hold your attention.

Definitely felt like they followed the original Asian culture and world building that was in the cartoon, however there was not a lot of opportunity to get to admire and enjoy the world as the series progressed.\\n\\nWriting (7/10): good dialogue and references to the original show, however, the deliveries fell short and the depth/emotion for the characters was lacking.\\n\\nOverall worthy of a 6/10. If you are looking for an accurate true to the cartoon story, then you will be disappointed (though not as much as the movie). If you approach it with an open mind and are willing to take a new idea on the world of Avatar, then it can be enjoyable and good.\",\n",
       " \"Before going into depths I would like to note that I could imagine how hard it was to work on a story, which was made long ago and has its large fan base. I mean I am a fan, and I think re-watched the animated series 10 or 20 times.\\n\\nIn my opinion, the creators managed to let us view the story from new angles without hurting 'fan feelings'. Netflix adaptation looks kinda deeper into the motivation of each character and exposes them more to the audience. I enjoyed the way the authors of the adaption found ways to adapt some events from the original story into the series. It looked seamlessly. Special thanks to the battle scenes with a lot of action and special effects.\\n\\nAs for the actors, some of them did not look sincere or experienced and their acting did not touch me. Curiously enough these were the actors playing the 'good guys'. On the other hand, the actors who portrayed key antagonists from the Fire Nation did their job really well. Especially, Dallas Liu who portrayed Prince Zuko, I would like to really thank him for the work he has done while playing this role. His play was balanced, sincere and professional. I would also like to note the depth of some dialogs or monologs especially involving Uncle Iroh, they were deep with a lot of meaning.\\n\\nAll in all, as a fan, I should say that this is not that failure movie from 2010. It has disadvantages and advantages compared to the original story, but is definitely worth watching.\",\n",
       " 'The positive of the show is that I feel like I am immersed into the setting. I feel like i am watching ATLA. This is something a lot of adaptations now a days are getting wrong. They try and rework so much where you loose the feeling of what was originally created.\\n\\nThere are some flaws here and there but honestly, if you are watching the show to find those flaws you will not like this show.\\n\\nIf you just watch it to watch it, you really wont notice them which is a great positive!\\n\\nUnfortuantly, you can not adapt the cartoon style of story telling into a movie as cartoons allow the characters to be more expressive.\\n\\nI think they did their best in over exagerating the main, characterists of the character.',\n",
       " 'With this series it feel very hollow,empty, and not fulfilling at all. Maybe because I haven\\'t finished it but it\\'s so hard to get through. Aang isn\\'t any where as goofy as he was in the original but even in the original he knew when he had to be serious. The remake Aang was overplaying the \"serious acting\" and even if he was going add the goofy trait it\\'ll seem forced, as the all around acting seems anyway.\\n\\nThe CGI isn\\'t all the way horrible but in a lot of scenes it\\'s unbearable to notice it being used.\\n\\n(Same with the green screen affect)\\n\\nI had high hopes for this remake but I guess some things are better off ANIMATED.\\n\\n(this is my first review btw)',\n",
       " \"The casting is fantastic. 100% on point! The acting by everyone was amazing too. I saw a YT video with the actors for Zuko & Katara doing a play by play review of a fight scene with some behind the scenes. I was ABSOLUTELY impressed with their acting there. That video is the reason I started watching it. I have been rewatching and rewinding ever since. Too bad season 1 has so few episodes. That's the only thing disappointing. I absolutely loved the interaction and dynamics between uncle Iroh and Zuko as well. The only other negative is they seemed to have cheaped out on makeup and FX for a couple of scenes, but overall not a big deal. I REALLY REALLY HOPE they do more than 3 seasons.\",\n",
       " \"I have just finished watching the first season of Avatar: the last airbender. Full disclosure, I have watched the animation series before, but I don't remember it all that well. And also last Monday I finished watching the terrible season 4 true detective finale (It's so nice to see a series with an actual story and character development!). Anything I watched after that disaster would've probably been better. And yes this is a lot better!\\n\\nI quite liked this season of Avatar. It is certainly a show made for kids. I think my nephews would like this a lot more than I did. Nevertheless, I found it to be an enjoyable adventure story. If you're constantly making notes to all the differences between this and the original whilst watching than I'll do you a solid: do not watch this! This is not a like for like remake of the animation series. My enjoyment comes from me not remembering the original story and seeing this as its own thing. A lot of the actors in this are very young. As with all young actors it's really a hit or miss depending on the scene. Sometimes they nail it sometimes they don't. I do think that a younger audience (that this is clearly aiming for!) are more forgiving of the acting performances than I am.\\n\\nAll right so I do have one minor issue. Out of our four main characters (Aang, Katara, Sokka and Zuko) I think Aang drew the short end of the stick. I feel like Katara, Sokka and even Zuko have had more character development than Aang did. I like the stories of Katara and Zuko the best. I don't remember much of the animation series but I do remember that Aang was constantly learning and not just learning the bending of the elements. His story arc has largely stayed the same this season. I think it's great that the side characters are getting good character arcs. But I do hope that Aang's story Arc will be central in next season!\",\n",
       " \"I went in with an open mind and low expectations... it was pretty disappointing.\\n\\nThe bending is better than the movie, but the dialogue and acting style lacks any emotion. Like...any emotion... from any character. It's almost as if they were trying to be more serious, and it just comes off as bored and dull. It's to the point it's cringy and I can't even look.\\n\\nI was waiting for at least someone to shine but I can definitely tell why the original creators left the show now. Aang is so different and the same with Sokka and Zuko too. None of the humor is there from Aang or Sokka and Zuko has 0 anger in his voice.\",\n",
       " \"After watching the whole season I can safely say this adaptation was excellent!!! I can see fans of the series being disappointed in some alternate plot details but I believe it's time to see the bigger picture. It's time for the avatar legend to continue and the live action can do that. It can create and tell new stories even after the end of the original, and even though some plots were slightly changed, I dare say it was for the better. I've watched both the original and the live action and as a fan of the original I can say that some plot details were depicted clearer and even more descriptively than the original. However it's time to let comparisons go, it's time to see the avatar world rise once more because if it does not, we might not be ever able to witness the continuation of this story.\",\n",
       " \"I seriously don't understand how people can give it higher than a 6/10. I'm only 4 episodes deep myself, but I've already seen such ridiculous storyline changes that I almost don't feel like watching it through.\\n\\nIn addition to completely changing the chronological order of very important moments, they are constantly making things up. Copying the characters is very difficult because in the cartoon there are a lot of extreme cartoon-like facial expressions used, but that's exactly why it's so important to recreate the storyline 1 to 1.\\n\\nIn short, the series is really made for people who have not seen the cartoon. The visual effects are impressive and the bending of the elements are really good. Unfortunately, this does not outweigh the flaws in the story. Once again, a flop....\",\n",
       " 'As a fan of the original I decided to give this a fair shot. Watch it with fresh eyes so to speak. So going from there I will start with the bad - the pacing is a bit weird (very fast) and consequently skips over character development moments, especially \"in action\". They talk a lot about what they\\'re thinking and it doesn\\'t come off natural. Simply - the dialogue could be a lot better. And the casting doesn\\'t help. I like a few actors (disregarding how close they actually come to the original char), specifically Sokka, Ozai (probably the best) and a few \"supporting\" chars that are not present that often. The rest I can only describe as beginner actors. Especially Katara and uncle Iroh. Aang.. is also not the best but not as bad.\\n\\nNow the neutral - I\\'m not mad how they restructured the plot, that\\'s fine as it is an adaptation. Very little humor involved, but it is there sometimes. Mentioning Azula here would be fitting - she\\'s alright. But really Zuko and Azula look like little children to me which seems wrong. One more thing I cannot clear from my biased mind is Mai... She was such a badass skinny goth and they cast her as a slightly chubby yes girl. But I put those things in neutral because it\\'s just my bias to the original. I could list a lot here but it\\'s not productive. The original chars are just not what you can expect here at all.\\n\\nThe good - the visuals. God they crafted a wonderful world. The environment, the CGI, fights - it is just amazing. I am truly amazed at this part and I honestly thought this would be the bad part, but it was actually flipped. I imagined the acting and dialogue would be HEAPS better and the world toned down but nooope. Everything went into the visuals.',\n",
       " \"For anyone complains about the rush story, you have to consider the fact that these cast AGE! Esp kids, they'll grow up really fast and don't have enough time to follow the original episode by episode, so I understand why they have to cut off parts.\\n\\nThe acting is decent to me, natural, not over-acting or something, tho I admit there are some quite cringey scenes (especially romantic ones). Aang is perfectly casted, his smile is vibrant, truly Aang's nature. CGI's good enough. And I agree the story could have written better. But I can see the potential and this series is really worth trying! I'm an Avatar fan myself and I'm so looking forward to the next season.\",\n",
       " \"I'm halfway through the first season, and I've noticed a concerning pace in the storyline. Despite having roughly 400 minutes of runtime across eight episodes, the adaptation feels hurried, missing the depth of its animated predecessor, which had about 460 minutes spread over 20 episodes. Key character-building moments from the original have been omitted, replaced by new plots that, in my opinion, feel unnecessary or prematurely introduce elements from later in the series.\\n\\nSo far, Zuko is the only character showing any real development. Despite the introduction of new storylines, the depth of character growth remains lacking. The performances, aside from those of Zuko and Iroh, are disappointing. The cast seems disconnected, as if their participation was reluctant.\\n\\nIt's unclear whether the subpar acting stems from a lack of talent, experience, or poor writing. The dialogue comes across as monotonous and awkward, missing the original's playful humor. The decision to alter Sokka's character to fit modern sensibilities was misguided in my view. A few offbeat jokes in a fantasy series aren't reflective of the creators' views on social issues - changing this was unnecessary and led to diluted character interactions filled with bland, generic dialogue. I believe even an AI like ChatGPT could have crafted more authentic scripts, especially by preserving key conversations from the original.\\n\\nOn a positive note, the visual effects surpassed my expectations. The team managed to convincingly recreate the bending techniques within a reasonable budget, a commendable feat for a live-action adaptation.\\n\\nDespite my criticisms, I've rated the series a 7 out of 10. I believe it could captivate new viewers or those who haven't seen the original series in years. The world of Avatar remains enthralling, with its rich lore likely to engage fans old and new. For me, however, having recently revisited the original series (few weeks ago), this adaptation falls short of recapturing the magic that made the original so memorable. I hope that the rest of the season proves me wrong.\",\n",
       " 'The script and the acting is literally so bad you might wanna puke. Like you can tell theyre trying to act, especially that Katara girl.\\n\\nThe script is horrible and cringe. No character development, theres no humour whatsoever and story is a bit rushed.\\n\\nIs it better than the movie ? Maybe.\\n\\nIs it a good series to watch ? I dont think so\\n\\nI think the director miscast a lot of roles here. The only decent actor here is that Zuko guy\\n\\nWell, i think netflix should stop making a careless anime adaptation like this because for ATLA fans its literally their childhood.\\n\\nIt was painful to watch It really was.',\n",
       " \"Overall, I'd say the changes were justified in order to produce a fast-paced plot that would give twitchy Netflix subscribers no excuse to click away due to boredom. Maybe the writers were a bit too paranoid about it, but it did hit #1 in almost every country Netflix serves, so they got what they wanted, and no doubt there will be a season two, where hopefully they can slow down, let the story breathe, let the kids goof around, and generally stop being so panic-stricken.\\n\\nBefore then, the kids playing Aang, Katara and Azula need some acting lessons, and the writers need to sharpen up the writing for Azula so she is more convincing as a strategic genius who Daddy thinks could be a worthy successor, and who could lead a conquering army. So far, she comes off as a little brat. But they can turn that around in season 2.\\n\\nFavorite characters: Sokka, Zuko and of course the Cabbage Merchant. Looking forward to the next season.\",\n",
       " 'This adaptation has no resemblance with the original in any shape or form if you look at it from the story. It is so simplified and lacks any depth that it doesnt convey the multifaceted messages the original conveyed perfectly. It begs the question as to why would any sane person do this? They somehow thought the idea of taking 4-5 Episodes from the original from different seasons and different locations and put it in blender and just mix it into a mush that has no quality left at all. Also the acting is really bad because they cant act the way the characters are and have totally different personalities. The only good are the animals and locations like Omashu. As a fan i am deeply dissapointed and can completely understand why the Original Writers dont want anything to do with this. Clearly Netflix doesnt care. I just cant wrap my head around how this is popular. After watching this insult i had to watch the original to not explode from pure shock.',\n",
       " \"I like the live action. I believe every media has its own way of telling a story. Don't expect an animated project or a live action or a comic art or literature to tell a story the same way. Keep an open mind.\\n\\nThe best thing this live action did was showing us the details that we didn't see in the animated series like the Airbenders genocide, Azula's arc becoming a perfectionist, the roots behind Sokka's issues with his dad and why he really wants to prove to him that he's a great warrior, and what happened to the solders who Fire Lord Ozai wanted to sacrifice and Zuko stood up for and had a dule with with his Father. The lives action tried to not repeate the original material but it stayed faithful to it by showing parts of the picture that we couldn't see and told the story in a way that's straight to the point and suitable for a live action.\\n\\nI like how the show handled the issue of the Northen water tribe regarding women not being allowed to fight. It ended by all women in the tribe standing up against Paku talking sense to him and the new generation of male water benders admiring katara's fighting.\\n\\nNot her fighting him then he finds out that she is his ex's granddaughter then she gets a pass! I wanted to know how later the women in the northen tribe became allowed to fight because we saw in the legend of Korra her cousin Eska was allowed to fight. I just assumed that there's a time after the war Katara changed the mind of the rest of the tribe because it seemed that only Katara got a pass.\\n\\nThe point is things can be told differently and this depends of on the medium and budget and all those factors affect how a story should be told. You can't have fillers and extra side stories in a live action specially if it's ment to be short. This one is an adaptation. They tried to take the best elements of each episode and combined them into one story arc.\\n\\nIf you want something exactly similar to the source material, just go and rematch the animated series period.\",\n",
       " \"The series failed to capture the internal struggle of Aang as to why he ran away. The series choses to cut the important moments which are monumental in deciding what Aang's willingness to take that important step.\\n\\nMost of the dialogs are forced without any real emotion to back them up. They totally aren't able to recreate the original series funny moments which were a key to their bonding.\\n\\nMoreover, Iroh is one of the strong characters but here fails to make any impression. First time watchers will soon forget him. Deviating too far from the original script is a decision which is back firing this season1.\",\n",
       " \"I am a huge fan of the original animated series. I've seen it about 15-20 times. I always learn something new every time I watch it.\\n\\nThis live action was brilliant in its own way. It stuck close to the original but also had creative freedom to dive deeper into the characters which I really appreciated and change the story slightly to make it flow better for an older audience. There were a bunch of things different from the animated vision that took me a second to get over and once I did I really enjoyed it and it kept me on my toes.\\n\\nI can completely understand why every episode wasn't verbatim because A) that would be boring as heck B) it'll be way too costly and C) it wouldn't work in live action. With that being said, I did miss the comedic parts from Sokka or how much of a child Aang is like when he wanted to ride the penguin seals and the Unagi. I also missed Uncle Iroh carefree tea-drinking attitude towards life. I also had to remember that the animated series was made for children and not adults. Whereas I believe this live action was more created for the people that grew up watching the original and wanted something more sophisticated. As for the love at first sight with Aang to Katara, it worked in the animated series but in alive action in 2024 a child liking an older girl and them falling in love would be weird. I think the writers felt the same.\\n\\nZuko is one of my favourites and I liked how they dove more deeply into his character and his past. It gave him even more depth to what I already know about him. It was awesome to watch him become angry due to home circumstances. It was also wonderful to see how and why Uncle Iroh joined him looking for the Avatar. Adding the story about the 41st was an amazing addition. It wasn't just Zuko and Uncle Iroh that they added some tasty tidbits into their back story they actually did that with a lot of the characters. It added to the story, an unexpected bonus. I was also pleased that all the big parts that need to be there were there more or less.\\n\\nI also found the special effects really good while keeping that animated-ish essence. The world building was epic and the bending was top notch. Did you see the ostrich horses? So cool.\\n\\nWhat I found awesome was it was filmed in Vancouver Canada. Some of the actors like Gordon Cormier (Aang) Kiawentiio (Katara) and Paul Sun-Hyung Lee (Uncle Iroh) all great Canadian actors among other Canadians that had rolls along the way. Also, shout out to Tamlyn Tomita (Yukari). She was in The Karate Kid Part II (1986) as Kumiko. Great to see her.\\n\\nI believe the folks that didn't like this wanted it to be verbatim of the original or remember the other live action movie from 2010 as being crap, and it was. They already had an idea of what they wanted from it. Their expectations were doomed to let them down so, they hated it and gave it a poor rating and review. I'm not sure why any one would want to watch a remake carbon copy. How boring would that be? Go watch the original if that's what you're looking for.\\n\\nIs it different? In some parts, yes!\\n\\nWas it entertaining? Heck yes!\\n\\nDid it have the same essence of the OG? It sure did.\\n\\nI highly recommend watching this with an open mind and invite the differences as part of the Avatar: The Last Airbender world in, not because you want to hate on it but because you love that world. You'll gain some more insight into each character.\\n\\nI'm really looking forward to seeing how they adapt and meet new characters like Toph, Combustion Man or Hama. I can't wait to see Ba Sing Se and the Western Air Temple. Just like Pakku said to Katara: Change is good!! I can't wait to see what other things they add to build on each character as well.\\n\\nBring on season 2!!\",\n",
       " \"Excellent bending and CGI, some good fight scenes, some good moments from the actors. A few changes for the better. Gyatsu was so good that I cried during the first ep. Unfortunately Iroh, such an important character, didn't have the same energy as the original. I can't even talk about Bumi's personality. Several character arcs lost their essence, including Aang and Katara. Unnecessary narration, several unnecessary speeches. Some confusing and chaotic episodes. Many lines completely opposite to the character's personality. Calm moments are missing. Dallas Liu (Zuko) carries the series almost single-handedly, I have that to be grateful for.\",\n",
       " \"Don't listen to the ever present nay sayers. This adaptation was incredibly watchable. I made it through the first season (thrice!) fully invested and entertained. This rendition brings Avatar into adult-hood. While it did a good job of maintaining some of the silliness that ricocheted Avatar into fandom, it incorporated more mature and violent action scenes and adult concepts that I appreciated. Some of the acting was sub-par, but nothing that I couldn't move past. Overall, it was a success to me! . And I'm really happy that Netflix renew it for 2 seasons, I hope they do better job in VFX and terms of more episodes, cause the real events begin now!\",\n",

       " \"The plot of the animation is great, but the relationships and character development made it a masterpiece. Not enough time is devoted to characters relationships or development in the live action. The plot is also worse but that is excusable given the difficulty of adapting a show like this.\\n\\nAn attempt was made to make the show much more serious and dark in tone, they succeeded at the cost of most of the reasons I liked the animation. The serious tone means that it is much more difficult to include the goofy comedy the animation has. Sokka has a couple sarcastic jokes, but without Aang as a foil it falls flat for me. Katara is the biggest tragedy however. In the animation she has genuine excitement about bending and seeing the world, she has a bit of a temper (especially when it comes to Sokka), she has an impulsive side (the water bending scroll), she uses sarcasm frequently (making it obvious she grew up with Sokka). All of that is gone, to be honest most of what made her a fun character is gone.\\n\\nThe CGI for the most part is very good, as is the fight choreography, it's cool to see bending done justice in live action.

Showing that being the avatar is not all fun and games and antics, it's also not about facing dangers alone. The bending in this is a thousand times better than what Shyamalon did, at least these people kept the bending art, even make it a little more realistic with movements.

I'm kinda having a problem on how they portray Bumi here because in the OG series he is funny and sarcastic but intelligent and gives good advices to Aang at the same time and that's what make him a very unique character.\\n\\nThe bending is also surprisingly wonderful.

I usually finish any series if I find it appealing and upto the story but this whole series I watch was rather like coping mechanism for me. Just for the sake.

While I get not always being able to film on location, with how obvious the greenscreen is the immersion of the story just falls a bit flat in my opinion.\\n\\nAnd though design-wise the production team really nailed the creatures, wardrobe and environments from source material, through the way of filming and editing, a lot just feels fake. In comparison to an abundance of medium views and close-ups, it becomes noticable there aren't many wide-view shots to even visuals out throughout an episode.\\n\\nThe biggest downer of this adaption hower is how the fun and lovable characters are completely gone or simply not compelling enough. The acting was not solid and watching the main gaang being all business 24/7 leaves no room for forging believable bonds with one another and by the end of the last episode, it just doesn't feel as if the strong-implied-friendship made is real. The only actual chemistry felt in the whole show was between Zuko and Iroh.\\n\\nNext to that, due to maybe a lack of experience and weird scripting it also felt at times as if the main gaang were being outperformed by side characters such as Zhao, Teo and his father (honorable mentioms to them by the way.) This also brings up another point, the awkward dialogue and blatant exposition in this adaptation is truly awful. Being spoonfed the lore of the ATLA world or having characters say their inner thoughts aloud is not the way to go for existing fans nor newcomers and honestly just dumbs down the series a whole lot.\\n\\nAll in all, main plot is rushed, acting could be better, exposition and dialogue is exasperating, choreography, designs and visuals are stunning but cinematography feels off.\\n\\nThis adaptation has the potential to be great, but not with how it stands currently.\",\n",

I think the director miscast Katara and Zuko, I do not feel their character's energy, their face expressions are so bland\\n\\nThe only saving grace of this live action series is the acting performance from the senior actors & actresses.\",\n",
       " \"The tv series picked the best and more crucial moments of the anime tv series and brought them into this adaptation.\\n\\nIt's not perfect for sure, there are some narrative issues and mismatches and I think this is why the original writers of the anime series left the Netflix production.\\n\\nThat said, the changes made doesn't impact me at all, a fan who watched the anime series.\\n\\nCould be more fun? Sure, could the narrative and script be closer to the anime series? Absolutely. We know though that it won't be exactly the same, it's never has been with all other adaptations.\\n\\nThe visual effects are fabulous and The Avatar fans should be more thank grateful to having 3 seasons of it on Netflix.\",\n",
       " \"Is it worse then the movie? Almost. Should netflix stop making live action adaptations where they don't care about the source? Yes. The acting is terrible and the story is butchered. The character growth isn't there. Aang and his crew do stuff just to do stuff and it's so unbelievable. There's no rhyme or reason to the show. I now fully understand why the original creators of the show left. Netflix just doesn't respect the source and their fans. I'm really dissapointed I expected a good show once it was announced, after the creators left I was skeptical, I thought maybe they just left because of new animated shows. After the articles came out I was scared. But I wasn't scared enough. This show is terrible!\",\n",
       " \"To sum it up: GOOD: music, VFX, antagonist, character chemistry, world building. BAD: rushed story, earthbenders, some modern language.\\n\\nIn the last 16 years, I've watched the original animated show about 4 times. I even gave it 10 stars here on IMDB many years ago. I don't call myself a fan, but I do love the original show.\\n\\nAfter the first season of this live-action show, I like what they did with the known elements of the Avatar world (pun intended), since I wasn't expecting an exact copy of the original, nor I wanted one. I believe this new product can be enjoyed separately, considering how complex and expensive a live-action can get, compared to an animated show.\\n\\nVFX was mostly superb, and few times was a bit lacking. Nature elements VFX can be resource-consuming, and although there's room for improvement, it's mostly well integrated to character's movements and other scenes. Landscapes were amazing in most cases. Sound effects and music felt quite accurate for the show.\\n\\nAs for the characters, we will have to wait if audiences who didn't watch the show can keep up with all of them. They are a lot for an 8-episode first season, knowing that most of them should appear in the next seasons. Also, if this show keeps going, might be a good idea to make a movie for the final event.\\n\\nCharacter's chemistry was good, but could be better if it weren't rushed, which affected character development and relationships. It's a bit distracting the use of some modern language expresions, considering the epic and ancient tone the Avatar world has.\\n\\nWhile action scenes and fight choreographies were good (not much shaky camera, fortunately), martial arts movements related to element bending were a bit repetitive, and specially some secondary earthbenders' movements, were not solid nor tough (next season should do some justice to that and I'm looking forward how the will portray one specific earthbender). That being said, the personality of firebenders and earthbenders was intimidating and ruthless many times, which I appreciate they showed it. And the additional insight about airbenders was beautifully done.\\n\\nI enjoyed this show a lot, and I sincerely hope they continue and finish the story. Go Team Avatar!\",\n",
       " \"I feel like they had everything going for them, the set design, production, visual effects, even really good actors !! But the script and plotline fell flat. The actors are all pretty young and new to the limelight, and it was hard to see their potential but watch it go to waste with the awkward and almost forced words. The writers need to learn subtlety - well know its better to show than tell.\\n\\nI also don't understand why they need to make Netflix shows so short. It really is hard to condense the entire world of Avatar into 8 episodes, and I feel like fans will actually appreciate it more if they took the time needed to properly tell the story. Not even at least 10 episodes would've been ok? You can clearly see the writers struggle with this short timeline as seen by the rewritten plotlines that didn't mesh so well together in the end.\\n\\nStill halfway through and it seems like it's getting better. I'm hoping if there's a second season that they make major improvements.\",\n",
       " \"The actors who play Aang, Katara, and Azula need to be replaced. None of them capture their characters. I did not believe any of them and their performances fell flat. No emotional intensity, believability, or anything which caused the character's stories to not be properly conveyed. It seemed like the ones who played Aang and Katara were reading off the script and grasping in the wind for the point. Parts where they were supposed to be sad, angry, or excited were subpar. And the one who plays Azula is hardly vicious enough for that role. The character in the cartoon version was ruthless and I didn't get that in her performance. The most I get is spoiled, pissed off brat. And that was not Azula's character. But otherwise, everyone else was great. Awesome special effects but I'm kinda disappointed the story really never went anywhere. Aang didn't learn any other disciplines or anything... Yet they skipped to parts of the story where he'd already been progressing. I will watch season 2, but they need to get it together. New Aang, Katara, and Azula.\",\n",
       " 'The best live action version to date. Although some changes to the storyline are made, none change the general story of the original series. The actor for Aang does a great job. Sokka is spot on. Katara is far better. All in all, a good 1st season. I suspect as the other seasons come out, it will do nothing but improve as the writers and actors settle into the roles and the story progresses. As with any new series, the first season can feel shaky at times. If memory serves me right, the origional animated series was stronger during seasons two and three. All in all, what I have seen so far keeps with the origional story and character building. I recommend watching this one.',\n",
       " \"Honestly, it was better than I thought it would be. In comparison to the 2010 live action take, this adaption at least adheres far closer to the source material while taking the obvious creative liberties.\\n\\nPros\\n\\nDallas Liu's portrayal of Prince Zuko is spot on. A stand out performance for sure. In fact, I like everything the creators of the live action did with Zuko. They hit the mark every time with this guy.\\n\\nJoining Dallas Liu in character portrayal and delivery is Ian Ousley, who delivers a pretty good portrayal of Sakka's dry wit humor. Imo, I feel that Sakka is by far the trickiest character to really nail down in a live action adaption. He's largely comedic relief but then he illustrates spurts of brilliance and seriousness here and there. I feel like Ian did an excellent job navigating the nuances of Sakka's character for the most part.\\n\\nThe Bending is fantastic and the fight choreography is pretty good.\\n\\nThe dynamic between Fire Lord Ozai, Azula, Iroh and Zuko was very well done.\\n\\nCons\\n\\nI found the depth between Team Avatar lacking. The actors who play Aang, Katara and Sakka don't have any on screen chemistry, no emotional depth. They feel more like stage actors reading lines at each other than actors owning their characters respected roles.\\n\\nOddly enough, Aang and Katara don't have any on screen presence compared to their animated counterparts. Katara's personality is like she's an NPC. She doesn't have any real agency and she feels largely like a background character in her own story. Aang is no different. In this adaptation he doesn't FEEL like the main character and again, his character lacks agency.\\n\\nProphetic dreams drive the plot. For some reason Aang's journey is propelled by a random dream sequence of the Fire Nation attacking the Northern Water Tribe... but in the animation, it was a rather very simple reason that triggered Aang, Katara and Sakka to journey up north and that was to find a waterbending master for the BOTH of them to learn from. That's it. That's what started it all. I get for the TV adaption, there is a need to create tension by illustrating certain doom, but this is also a lazy approach. The original animation already laid a simple groundwork that could have easily been lifted into the live action without the need of dream sequences to do most of the legwork.\",\n",
       " \"I am an avid fan of the cartoon but even I know translating this into live-action shouldn't be shot-for-shot. Everyone's expections watching live-action are different than animation. This show had so many cringy moments that don't work in live-action. But the visuals were well done and the special effects didn't look cheesy. But, boy, was that dialogue cheesy. I found myself laughing at the poor acting. This is the blame of the director. How do I know that? Because I've seen some of these actors in other projects and they didn't act that poorly. It ruined the show for me. I'm hoping continued shows will improve acting and directing.\",\n",
       " 'New \"Avatar: The Last Airbender\" Live Action Review\\n\\nOff the top, I love it. It\\'s not an easy task to truncate 24 episodes into 8 regardless of the triple time 50 min length per episode.\\n\\nCASTING They stayed true to the characters and their personalities. The casting is on point. And ask you, how many opportunities do you see a diverse cast ABCENT of leading white character(s) or a single white \"hero\" that saves a BIPoC cast... in original English language?\\n\\nSCRIPT They largely maintain the course of events well and even with the blending of arcs, they overlap and weave together without feeling crunched. I do however acknowledge they unnecessarily messed with Koh (the face stealer), though; but not enough to compromise the integrity of the production.\\n\\nART & VX The costuming, colour timing, and editing are tight, and unrushed.\\n\\nThe bending... omg the bending. The care they took to create a realistic effect is SO MUCH subtler than what people appreciate. (I used to work in film) they are using a combination of digital and practical effects which results in movement that seemingly obeys physics. There\\'s weight, and resistance to create the effect the bender essentially commands the element move in a manner within those properties. EXCELLENT!\\n\\nLIVE ACTION vs ANIMATION The motion and dialogue have translated well. It\\'s difficult to find the right timing with humour. I think Sokka could have been a little punchier, but his sardonic wit is there, and I hope we see it expand as the character gains confidence with his place on the team.\\n\\nTHEMATIC INCLUSION And now something I didn\\'t expect, but it greatly suits the attenuated maturity of live action and not something that could be highlighted in an age 8+ animated show. THAT IS THE INCLUSION of war trauma and its impact on society, its people and how... generational it is.\\n\\nThe particular moment with Iroh, comes to mind, but there are many to choose from. Regardless of how much we love Iroh, and regardless of his desire to seek redemption and balance-and later his allyship with the Avatar, he was in fact a war criminal. He acted on the behest of an Imperialist conquest. His actions brought of pain and a generation of trauma-even to himself. Looking someone in the eye about that was... well, it was complex. And I appreciated the show not letting him off lightly about it, and also weaving in the consequences of war-its impact, in other places in the show. Shown in this manner, it is UNIQUE to the live action.\\n\\nCONCLUSION All in all, I think this is a great live action adaptation. It feels like there was great effort and consideration in the making of this show. I can appreciate it for its own unique merits without abandoning the intensions of its source work.\\n\\n7.5 - 8/10.',\n",
       " \"I have to confess that I am totally unfamiliar with the anime which is the source of this series and so I cannot comment on how faithful this adaption is to its origin. I recognise that for many watchers, the faithfulness of this adaption to its source is going to make a big impact on how they rate it. I can only comment on how enjoyable this is as a stand alone series. To be honest, I really did enjoy this series. The story is strong enough, the effects and the sets are good enough to keep the viewers attention and even to binge watch. The only down side I can see - and it's a big one - is that the acting throughout is awful. The cast seems to have been chosen based on how oriental they look, not on how well they act. It's hard to find a single cast member whose acting talents are even average. The young lad who plays Aang is one of the worst. Half the time, he speaks so quickly it's impossible to understand what he is saying. Thank goodness for subtitles. I don't know if the original anime was Chinese or Japanese (or otherwise Asian) in origin, but this series is pure Hollywood and America. That's definitely not to its benefit.\\n\\nIn short, I enjoyed this but it is seriously flawed.\",\n",
       " 'Sorry I say this, but most of the acting of the diverse characters played by teens is bad, and of the adults, to be true, minimum the half too. Little actors were convincing, main characters so and so, but often the secondary ones were really bad. Not always its the fault of the actors, it can be casting, and it seems mainly to me that directors did not care much about that part. Or writers, seems they did not care much either about giving dialogues depth. If they cared, it did not came through too often.\\n\\nI was constantly thrown out of the story by the acting...\\n\\nCGI good, but what made that possible is the good art design. There often was detail and I would say love in designing the tribes & their logic, spaces, clothes; specially the ships. Also the bending choreographies were coherent.',\n",

I am enjoying everything else but the scripts and writing is the only thing that I have a problem with. I think they did not think that the viewers would noticed LOL. Which laughable because this is the era of internet opinions and people can be picky half the time.

Some of that is done well some is done horribly. The casting is perfect, set design, music, and pacing is near perfect. The child actors do a fantastic job. This show is meant for individuals who didn't watch the original and original fans who have aged. The only major issue I have with the show is the lack of humor. I miss the potty humor and the goofy scenes that filled the original. Die hard fans of the original will have some reservations but will appreciate many different aspects of this modern masterpiece.\",\n",

It felt very faithful to the story in that sense. There were even a few moments that were quite touching. I simply wish they took more time in the other areas.\\n\\nThe first half was perhaps the hardest to deal with in those areas as it felt like the writers simply added the exposition from the storyboard directly into the spoken dialogue of the characters rather than let the story and actions - or even inactions - tell the exposition. It felt entirely out of place in what I assume was to info dump to fit it in to the 1-hour blocks of eight-episodes they had while the original series' first season had 21 minutes for 20 episodes; there was a lot of dialogue that could've been cut or edited down.\\n\\nOther issues I had were in regards to direction: Sokka and Suki's story felt wrong in the way Suki was originally presented in her debut episode was not presented here, as was how they portrayed Boomy; more so even for Boomy. I don't know what they were thinking with his character. While the ending was somewhat similar, the journey there felt mean to the character.\\n\\nAll in all, I hope the show gets picked up as the last few episodes they seems to find something of a balance, although maybe it was masked by the overall events of the first season coming to a close. I hope that's not the case. I hope they learn from this season and come back stronger in the second.\",\n",
       " 'Avatar The Last Airbender. The most unexpected series I have seen on NETFLIX, my expectations heading into this series was not the best, with the reputation NETFLIX has on making animated series a live remake. This series pushed my expectations and burst it out of the roof. The pacing of the plot could be improved and with some adjustments it would be perfect, but visuals was the one thing that stood out to me, the colours was bursting with the story. Having proper actors and respecting the vision behind AVATAR was also important the casting director was good with their choices. Following the vision of AVATAR and staying with the plot is also important and i felt they respected the initial plot of AVATAR.',\n",
       " \"The Avatar (The Last Airbender) series tells the story of a young boy named Avatar who must master four elemental powers in order to rescue the planet and defeat an enemy. I didn't know about Avatar before, but after watching it, it has quickly become one of my favorite series. I can't wait for the next season, so I'm going to watch a cartoon series instead.\\n\\nFirst of all, they did a wonderful job when compared to the previous Airbender film (2010). The show looks fantastic, with good plot, sets, and colors. The young actor who plays Zuko does an outstanding job. The action moments are spectacular in terms of battle choreography. The visuals are fantastic with Bending techniques, the way the elements link with the body of the characters, and the locations are all beautiful. They bring the world to life. However, that is not what Avatar is about. The live series missed significant character development aspects because there were too many plot points and characters to squeeze into fewer episodes. Above all, Aang's story revealed nothing special about him. If I changed perspectives and made Zuko the main character, the entire situation would change. And the story would become more interesting to watch. About the character's role and appearance, I'm annoyed by the Sokka character. I don't understand how Sokka was able to kiss two girls in such a short period of time. It doesn't make any sense to me. Moreover, Princess Yue reminds me of my grandmother. She has white hair, which does not suit her age of 16 years old, and she has tied her hair up, which makes her look much older than she is, which bothers me a lot.\\n\\nTo conclude, for those who have not seen the original, I believe this series is worth viewing, but it should do better in the future. I'm hoping they have a larger budget from Netflix for season two, which will allow them to stay truer to the script.\",\n",

You can't just carbon copy an anyme to live action, because everything will feel extremely cringe and wooden, which is exactly what happened here. Anime characters tend to feel older than they are, but something feels off when a 12 year old is saying something profound or a 15 year old is in charge of the military.\\n\\nThe acting isn't very good and everything feels like lines being read from a page.\\n\\nThere are worse things out there, but this isn't the amazing remake people were hoping for.\",\n",

The bending scenes are straight-up epic, and the CGI is on point. I was legit holding my breath during some of those fight scenes-they were that good.\\n\\nBut then there\\'s the pacing.

Yeah, they kinda lost some of their impact \\'cause they sped through \\'em.\\n\\nAnd don\\'t even get me started on the changes they made. Like, I get that they had to switch things up a bit for the live-action vibe, but some of it just felt unnecessary. Like, why mess with perfection?\\n\\nBut hey, it\\'s not all bad. The casting was pretty spot on. Aang, Katara, Sokka, Zuko-they all brought their A-game. And even though they tweaked some stuff, they still captured the heart and soul of the original series.

The pace is so rushed even though they have practically the same amount of time as the cartoon since each episode is almost an hour long, rather than 20 minutes like the original. The actors are doing all they can with the poor writing they aren't to blame when they aren't given good direction. I completely understand why the original creators left. Roku is funny and making jokes when in the cartoon when he's older he's much calmer than younger him. Also, the wigs, it is 2024, and they have a multi million dollar budget, it's honestly unacceptable.

A lot of these bad reviews are just people hating to hate because they have absolutely nothing better to do. If there isn't something to complain about they have to create something to complain about. But one of the biggest complaints I have heard from people is the CGI and I highly disagree. I think it looks great. It will definitely take some time to get used to characters like Azula and Zuko but I think people will eventually get used to them in later seasons. Music is perfect in this, action sequences are great, and the new additions to the story in this are some of the best parts. Where it does fall flat is making our main characters seem like close friends, in the original they seem like great friends right away and the dynamic is great, but in this the dynamic isn't really believable which is one of the best parts of the original.

The costumes are exactly like in the animated series and the bending is how I imagined it would in real life while I was watching as a kid.\\n\\nAll in all, it's certainly a fun little adventure to embark on, will entertain you and if you have similar taste as me you'll want more.\",\n",
       " 'Avatar: The Last Airbender\" has solidified its status as a cultural phenomenon, largely due to its meticulous world-building and the dynamic development of its characters. From its visually stunning landscapes to its captivating narrative arcs, the series initially captivates audiences. However, there are moments where rushed explanations betray a hint of lazy writing, undermining the depth of the storytelling.\\n\\nCharacters like Katara and Sokka, while initially engaging, are depicted with an excess of purity, lacking the nuanced flaws and complexities that would make them more relatable and multidimensional. Sokka\\'s early portrayal as somewhat misogynistic and Katara as overly motherly in the cartoon version added depth to their characters, reflecting the societal roles forced upon them. Similarly, Aang\\'s characterization showed progress from someone who initially was unprepared and immature, but who remained good despite trauma. His lack of preparation became his biggest strength.\\n\\nThis journey was extensive, and while the narrator understood it, explaining such complexities detracts from the depth of their journey, reducing it to a formulaic superhero trope that has been overdone in countless narratives. It\\'s a risk that threatens to diminish the uniqueness of the series, likening it to other franchises that have fallen victim to the homogenizing \"Star Wars treatment.\" As much as \"Avatar: The Last Airbender\" excels in many aspects, there\\'s a danger in glossing over intricacies that could elevate it to even greater heights of storytelling excellence.',\n",
       " \"What can I say... The entire cast was perfect, the visual effects were spectacular, the storyline was fantastic, and the experience overall was captivating.\\n\\nThey casted the PERFECT Aang, Katara, and Sokka and gave Aang the perfect edge for what's to come in season 2. I was definitely sceptical when I heard this was going to be released because I'm such a fan of the animated version. But I can honestly tell you that I was pleasantly surprised. It was incredible. One thing we have to talk about is the music. Wow what an epic experience they created with the soundtrack. All in all, epic!!!!!!!!!\",\n",
       " 'As a die hard fan, there is no escaping comparisons to the original. This is a fairly faithful adaptation in many aspects but deviates from the source material in places where it really matters.\\n\\nTo give credit where it\\'s due, the environment, costumes, makeup and effects are stunning. The world has been brought to life and it is incredibly immersive - but also faithful. It\\'s clear a lot of work went into making things look and feel modern without ruining the aura of the original. Every location is instantly recognizable to fans but it\\'s illustrative theming works wonders for even a first time watcher. No complaints here. The fighting choreography isn\\'t bad when it gets going but there are budget limitations without a doubt which do cause fights to end early and they often throw in more hand to hand combat than necessary to save on animation and digital effects that a long form bending fight would require.\\n\\nOn the other hand, both the actors and acting are a mixed bag. The older and clearly more experienced actors do a great job. Iroh and Ozai for example mimic their animated counterparts extremely well in both likeness and demeanor. I\\'m not expecting a 1:1 copy; obviously these are human beings and not drawn characters so some compromises have to be made, yet many of the characters do land.\\n\\nWith that being said, some really don\\'t. And generally speaking it\\'s the child actors which also happened to be the most important characters. Aang and Katara especially just do not align with how they are represented in the original. Whether it be a lack of experience, lack of direction or the changes to the script, it just doesn\\'t work. Aang is probably the biggest miss which hurts the most.\\n\\nPart of this has to be that there are actors this time, not just voice actors. You can\\'t exactly have a 20 year old playing a 12 year old on screen, but this is completely possible in animated works. There isn\\'t a great way to solve this issue, but it still ruins many lines nonetheless. Zuko doesn\\'t have the anger and pain in his deep voice while Aang lacks the fun loving and determined aura he always has. It is especially bad when multiple young characters are on screen together. I mean Azula, Mai and Ty Lee look and sound nothing like how they are supposed to and I honestly ended up laughing the first time they were on screen together.\\n\\nLastly, the story. It got shaken up quite a bit but the key elements are mostly there. If you are a fan you will be scratching your head in many moments thinking \"that\\'s not how this happened\" and it can be off putting. Stripping out \"filler\" content is inevitable when condensing the show to 8 episodes and you do lose a lot of character building in the moments taken out but it\\'s not the end of the world. They did however make some pretty drastic changes to many of the reasons, beliefs and emotions that play huge roles in the original. This is the most unforgivable sin and it feels like the writers completely misunderstood the creators intentions. There are times when the motivation for an event is just completely at odds with how the original conveyed it and it ends up landing horribly. This is true even for someone who hasn\\'t seen the anime because of how they failed to capture the emotional weight the scene by changing it up.\\n\\nOverall, it\\'s not bad. If you aren\\'t already a fan but like fantasy you will probably enjoy it. The script has its weaknesses and the child actors are a let down at times but the world building and authenticity does immerse you in a good time. If you are a fan, forget about the events matching up and the characters having the same emotional weight behind their decisions. It\\'s no where near as good as the masterpiece which is the original.. but it\\'s a fun watch anyway.',\n",
       " 'The story and effects r really great. The most devastating disaster are the actors. It seems like they have opted for the cheapest cast available in the talent market. Horrible screenplay and editing. The casting and the blooming love stories are just too much to handle. Just a wasted opportunity with such a great story and current technology. The expression less actors make it a horrible watch. Eventually one gives up, as there is no connection happening with the screen life. Its such an iront that the cast director found every actor which is at their worst. Cant stand anymore, E3 is the farthest i could go.',\n",
       " \"As someone who remembers the original animated series and grew up with the franchise in the 90s all I have to say is wow the series Is incredible it's perfectly adapted and a lot better and faithful than the original film in the 2000s I absolutely think that the cast was perfect the premise is really cool and there's a lot of things that give you hope and it's very violent and gory and not afraid to take risks and the best possible way something that I don't remember the original anime or film did at all I absolutely hope this series will go on for many years to come and I highly recommend anyone watch it.\",\n",
       " \"I am a fan of the original animated series. I am not a fan of the M Night Shaymalan movie. What makes this live action series great for me is the casting. The main cast character I fell in love with is Uncle Iroh played by Paul Sun-Hyung Lee. I thought that Mako defined this role, but I was wrong. Paul's Uncle Iroh is so endearing, supportive and cares and that caring goes beyond Zuko, he cares about the world. I feel Paul was born to play this role. I also thought that Daniel Dae Kim does an excellent job playing Firelord Ozai. He plays Ozai as a coniving, manipulative, power hungry character, that is a terrible father. I love the complexity of this evil character. The other standout character and actor is Amber Midthunder as Princess Yue. She played this character so close to the animated series, it was uncanny. I also loved the choices for Aang, Katara, and Sokka. They were right on the mark for playing these characters versus the movie. Gordon Cormier, Kiawentiio and Ian Ousley were perfect for the roles. I also loved animated Appa. This character is the best Appa of the three. I loved his tale and his face. Also, the special effects for the Water, Earth, and Fire bending is better than the movie. I do not expect live action to be as good as the animated series, but it comes very close and was satisfying for me in this live action series. What I could not believe happened to me, is that I was sucked into the series and I binge watch it the first time and could not stop watching. I was hooked on the series emotionally and was tearing up, laughing, yelling at the TV screen and all in all thoroughly engrossed in the characters and the story. I read somewhere that someone calls this a love song to Asian actots. Well, I loved all the actors in this series. The scenes that were especially impactful were finding the Avatar, visiting Kyoshi Island, finding the Southern Air Temple, visiting the Fire Temple, visiting with Bumi at Omashu and the climatic battle at the Northern Water Temple. I really hope that Netflix renews this for at two more seasons to play out the story. If not, at least I got to see this excellent live action remake and I like that they made it more for an adult audience. Thank you Netflix for an emotional good time.\",\n",
       " \"Same mistake with most live action adaptations , they take the source material, they scrap it and they make something that seems familiar but isn't . I know that some things have to change but not entire storylines . Characters feel like that are missing something, set pieces look good . Moreover , they took pieces and little things out of everything and they tried to blend it all together with out explaining, just for the viewer to kinda feel nostalgic of the original . I am not hating it , but I cannot like this either . Some key moments from the OG feel forced and a bit rushed . Casting is excellent though.\",\n",
       " 'Adapting a show like Avatar to live action, reliant on child characters and tons of visual effects, is a tall task (ask M. Night).\\n\\nThis show manages to pull it off as well as anyone could hope for.\\n\\nIt is a bit more serious/less silly, but still manages to capture much of the charm of the cartoon. All of the major themes are still conveyed, and no characters are butchered. The young actors are usually the downfall of shows like this, but the cast does a good job. The visual effects are downright impressive and the bending looks great. There is even a unique storyline addition that was brilliant.\\n\\nCompared to the previous attempt to adapt this show, this is a 20/10. I will definitely tune in to a season 2.',\n",
       " \"The first movie adaptation was horrible. This is significantly better, but still shares many of the same issues as last time. Weird pronunciation of words like avatar. The writing is not compelling. Actors are high school drama quality. Being good at acting is more important than being a black belt. The creators of the TV show left the project. Whoever decided they knew better than the creators should've been fired on the spot. This is why the quality of TV these days is poor. Great, there's no white people. What an accomplishment. I could write a better script than this if you gave me a week.\",\n",
       " \"I was hyped up for this because the original creators were apart of this, so I figured it would at least be worth watching. Until they left over creative differences, so my worries began to grow. I've read the many average reviews and was even more worried but I figured I'd at least give it a try, and boy were the reviews right.\\n\\nThis was just so disappointing and felt wrong from the very beginning. It's as if the original was the perfect meal you've ever had and then someone comes out and tries to replicate it but serves you the most bland, tasteless meal full of disappointment and despair that just makes you feel like a chump. I stopped watching it after the second episode and had to start the original just to get the awful taste out of my mouth.\\n\\nSpecial effects are ok, the acting effort is ok, the story is the same big picture but unfortunately without any of the character development scenes that let the characters grow into what they need to become. They even changed the crucial details that tied the whole avatar process with the moral of the story which was infuriating.\\n\\nTry it if you want but prepare to be disappointed.\",\n",
       " \"So as a massive fan of the animated series, I was extremely sceptical of this adaptation especially considering what we got with the previous live attempt.\\n\\nWhilst there are things to nit pick about, this show comes super close to showing us this Avatar world that we love. The actors did their damn best and the team that CGI'd the environment gave it more than their 100%. I was pleasantly glad I got to see this show! Uncle Iroh and Zuko absolutely killed it, just a phenomenal job representing the greatest relationship and character arc that Avatar has to offer.\\n\\nIf you're a returning fan, I recommend watching this with a new lens instead of perhaps comparing every little scene to the animation. We are never going to get anything close to the brilliance of the animation... this show does a good job making the attempt.\",\n",
       " \"People always have something to complain about. I don't understand these bad reviews. Yes it's not exactly the same, and yes maybe its not as funny as the original et cetera. But its impossible to make the live action exactly the same as the original, while also keeping the quality. A live action is just way different then a cartoon. Actually, the small changes in the story or the 'extra's', I like them.\\n\\nThe story is almost the same, the acting is very good (reminds me of the characters in the original one), and the visuals are amazing.\\n\\nI recommend less people complain, so we get a season 2 and 3.\",\n",
       " \"As someone who casually watched the original cartoon as a kid and binged the whole show a few years ago, I don't have the obsessive attachment to the cartoon that many fans do. Sure, the overall mood is darker, there's a few clunky lines of exposition, events have been moved around and some character arcs have been altered, but this adaptation still tells a great, heartfelt story with some great CGI and well-choreographed fight scenes. Some may say the story seems rushed, I say they removed the filler from the original show and stuck to its most relevant plot points.\\n\\nIt's an adaptation, not a scene-by-scene recreation. Netflix's Avatar does its own thing, but in my opinion still manages to keep the core heart and messages of the original story.\",\n",
       " \"The live-action Avatar series is... mediocre; many of its successes are overshadowed by significant flaws where it strips away the essence that defines certain characters, reducing them to something simpler and far from epic or transcendent, unlike its original series. Despite the effort to adapt a series with a lot of love and dedication behind it, this new installment feels like a mere compensation for the disaster that was its first attempt in the infamous 2010 movie. However, even though it's better than that, it falls short in creating its own identity that could serve as a catalyst for a fair and deserved adaptation on par with the original or, at the very least, evoke a fresh and new feeling that truly leaves the viewer wanting more. One thing I have to say about this new live-action is that it gives me hope that they'll deliver something where it's evident they put in more effort.\",\n",
       " \"Episode 1 starts off with a bang, a new addition like many, which adds more lore to the already rich story of the avatar universe. The adaptation does a great job of taking elements from the animated series but adds its own stuff.\\n\\nWhile I didn't enjoy some changes, for example, omission of certain characters and changing the arc of certain characters like Bumi, it still does good.\\n\\nThe story has a slight mature tone but that doesn't mean it 's not fun, which was the right decision. If the series was a 1:1 shot remake, it wouldn't translate well as a live action.\\n\\nOne or two episode seem rushed but all in all, it's a solid 8/10 adaptation. The portrayals are mostly good. I thoroughly enjoyed Zuko, Zhao & Kyoshi the most. The bending looks great and as a big fan, I can say the showrunners did a good job.\",\n",
       " \"CGI is pretty good but.....\\n\\nI think casting wise the actors seem like a good choice. The actual acting is hot garbage. Every. Single. Line. Feels. Forced.. This comes down to horrible script and directing... The actors that portray Aang and Katarra have this really weird head bobbling and weird facial expression thing going on. Iroh's actor sucks. Zuko's actor has some flash in the pan moments. Sokka's character is played fairly well. Lord Ozai is the only thing that's done really well. Azula's actor is the worst performance out of all of them, she's not intimidating AT ALL. No way does Azula have the capacity for lightning psshh.\",\n",
       " \"Imagine you never saw the original before this?\\n\\nATLA is somewhat decent adaptation that will likely seem average to many viewers, especially if you have seen the original. However, I believe this reception stems from the immense weight of expectations placed on it. The original animated series remains an undisputed masterpiece, and equaling, let alone topping, such brilliance is an incredibly tough if not an impossible challenge. Though this is a common issue for Netflix adaptations, ATLA also faces the unique pressure of living up to a series many consider nearly perfect as an animated show can be.\\n\\nYet despite these challenges, I found ATLA to be worthwhile viewing overall, especially to new viewers. The adaptation makes certain changes that give it a distinct identity from the source material, add to that a refreshing takes on casting, visuals, and cultural representation being particularly impressive, when compare to the other live-action. In fact, when compared to other live-action, these elements make this adaptation look top tier. While I sincerely hope that the second season build upon the first and smooth out some rough patches, this initial outing delivers an experience that, at its best moments, recaptures a little glimpses of the original's magic - even if it falls short of fully reaching those great heights.\",\n",
       " \"This is more to vent than anything. The show started off solid. IF you are hating the show 2 episodes in, I promised you it only gets worse.\\n\\nThe acting by Sokka and Zuko is solid, Aang and Katara look a little lost, and the rest of the characters arent their characters. I do appreciate the direction with zhao, but that said, not sure why they thought some of these cuts work.\\n\\nThe worst part is the story direction and lack of respect of even the most crucial plot points. Even on limited time they start sprinkling in season 2 plotlines and coming multiple episodes without regard. Some changes serve no purpose and only break canon.\\n\\nJust skip this and stick to the animated show, it's exponentially better and this show will likely be cancelled after season 2 because whoever was in charge of season 1 will likely still be around.\",\n",
       " \"Important things first: the passion for the world is there, and they knew what they were adapting. While we already knew years ago that this wouldn't be a full 1:1, changes are always a pill to swallow for some fans, even when it comes to smaller changes. I am happy to say that the core of ATLA is there, but that this feels like you are experiencing through a different lens, as if you are looking at the same artwork painted by a different artist.\\n\\nMeanless to say, this project feels like it has a hopeful future and after hearing the director and the cast talk about being very eager on doing the future seasons, let's hope Netflix does continue on until the end.\",\n",

One is a 10 minute scene where the Firelord explains his evil plan, second when we see his plan in action and third when our protagonist's grandma explains it to us (which is taken verbatim from the original show's intro).

If the actors were capable of actually acting, they could leave the camera rolling and have longer takes of matched up dialogue.\\n\\nBut .. anywho.\\n\\nThe CGI is shoddy, there's YouTube channels producing better CGI on a fraction of the budget.\\n\\nThe greenscreening is awful, particularly in the first episode with a boat, it looks like something from a 90s kids show.\\n\\nIs it worth a watch? Meh. Not really.\\n\\nThe cartoon exists, it may be older, but it is absolutely leagues ahead of this.\\n\\nCringe, bad effects, awful acting from the people cast because they look like the cartoon counter parts.\",\n",
       " \"Just finished watching, the best part is the VFX and amazing visuals. The last Airbender is nothing sort of compilation of same old stories of fighting a ruthless enemy and saving the world. It's same old cookies in new pack. Though with superior VFX it's good to watch. Amazing visuals is the USP of this series. Action sequences are awesome, acting is good , Aang is cute.\\n\\nStory telling technique is same old fashioned. Humour is missing. It's a fast moving series with excellent action scenes. Adaptation is same from its animated show, something new added would have been great. Going for 7 stars , Watch it for mesmerising visualisation.\",\n",
       " 'I wasn\\'t really sure about this show since I was pretty much disappointed by another netflix\\'s live action adaptation, One Piece. Many people probably don\\'t agree with me, but for me, one piece was very juvenile and cartoony - even the costumes in the show were cartoonish. It was just another animation with real people. Why bother making a live action adaptation if they aren\\'t gonna apply a real life seriousness into it? I can\\'t lie that kids did enjoy One piece a lot. The reason why I have \"reviewed\" One piece so far here is because Avatar: The Last Airbender is complete opposite. I could see a lot of seriousness and efforts all over the show including the costumes. CGI on the world building and fight scenes is quite seamless. Those effects of bending elements in the fight scenes are very convincing. The overall production is quiet impressive, and sure enough to entertain mature audience. This show can easily rank in top netflix shows of all time. It\\'s hundred miles better than One piece, and million miles better than Shyamalan\\'s Avatar. There are some cons of the show of course, and acting skills from some of the actors were questionable at some moments. If I have to pick one con of the show, Katara in the show is way, way off from the original animation character.',\n",
       " \"The visuals were top notch, the stylistic choices were good too. I think it's unfair to expect a live-action version of something to be the same as the cartoons, the whole point of it is to make it different. If people want to see the cartoon, go watch that. The things I disliked most about this series was the acting/actor choices for some roles. The azula squad was really bland in their acting, they played the same character it felt like, and there was no distinction apart from their dialogue. Also the acting of Katara was pretty bad.\\n\\nZuko, Aang (mostly for his age it was impressive), Suki and Yue their acting really carried the show.\",\n",
       " \"While the opening of the first episode was great exceeded my expectations. I love the visuals on the choreography of the bending, it was phenomenal, great. My problem is the words exchanging from one character to the other; that is what the live action fails in.\\n\\nThe casting for Aang was done great even though he is a child actor and everyone wants to be soft but I've seen great child actors and there's a lot of work to be done there.\\n\\nFor me the only person's who excels in the acting roles would be Prince Zuko, Princess Azula even the cabbage man did a good job, Commander Lee also did a great job. I thought the owl was poorly placed but good voice over.\\n\\nThe share-shoe mercenary did a great job.\\n\\nSuki was I think one of the best casting and I like the fact that Suki's mother appeared and she was the overseer of the village and once was a kyoshi warrior well done in that aspect.\\n\\nAnd I can't forget about Appa and Momo the CGI and visuals captures them really great well done.\\n\\nNow for the deplorable directing and casting that I just cannot stand.\\n\\nAdmiral Zhao is the worst! He comes across as a puppet. Admiral Zhao in the animated version, is confident cocky fearless, this man does not care and he gives off this intimidating aura. They missed the mark on Admiral Zhao because he could have been the star of the first season.\\n\\nThey also missed the mark on Fire Lord Ozai. I think he could have been more mysterious, devious, there should have been a more evil look to him. In the live action adaptation he is too well spoken. There is just something about the way he says things even though it's supposed to come across as malicious, stern and even condescending it comes across as polite which fire Lord Ozai is not polite.\\n\\nThey failed with so many other characters but Fire Lord Ozai and Admiral Zhao the ones that stand out. Hopefully the acting improves. I would love them to keep the maturity but also take some insights on the comments and rating of the first season.\",\n",
       " \"Wow okay, as a huge huge Avatar fan introduced to the show as a kid, I think this show is the best possible remake we can hope to get. Remakes inherently aren't going to be a 1 to 1 direct copy, which I think people just need to adjust their expectations to a bit.\\n\\nI initially had holdbacks for any/all changes to the show, but when thinking such changes through after episodes, they truly do make sense with the overall through line the show is developing. I love the first season of the animated show but this live action version certainly does a better job of establishing a consistent plot/flow throughout the season (the animated season does have a lot of filler episodes, which I lovingly admit).\\n\\nThe writers also clearly didn't make changes Willy Nilly, but with love and care. They reference loved aspects of the show they weren't able to fit in and even tie in tiny details from the comics. It's honestly fun to see the nods to the show we all love. And then they also do some of the most iconic scenes from the show almost exactly one to one (like the Masks episode was perfection).\\n\\nAnother gripe I consistently see is from others is on tone and humor. I honestly think this is a very reasonable change that suits the live action format. It's like they made a more realistic version of the original for the now-adult fans to enjoy. The GAang has experienced so much hardship and trauma - and it shows. While I do miss a lot of Aang's bubbly nature, we do still see it peek through and his changes make a lot of sense for a kid who has just lost his entire people. I honestly think it might be a strength of the live action to be able to have that darkness that a kids show for Nickelodeon couldn't.\\n\\nAnd speaking of characters, the casting for me is fantastic: Sokka is perfect (me literally SCREAMInG at the Sokka-Suki scene - be still my beating heart omg). Zuko is such a perfect angsty teenager, with Azula being acted so well. I love Katara's clear growth over the season and am excited to see these actors, especially the younger actors like Katara and Aang's, settle and grow into their roles in hopefully a second season.\\n\\nThose are just the parts I feel like I need to defend, but the bending and art of the season is absolutely beautiful (even coming from me a CGI hater). The fight scenes are gorgeous and Appa and Momo are utterly adorable. And Hei-Bei?? So well done.\\n\\nOverall, I think it a truly enjoyable show that was made with so much quality and love. Of course I have my small gripes here and there but I don't think that negates the positives of the show. I hope people can watch with open minds and a bit kinder hearts: it may have changes but at its core, it's creating and expanding the atla world in ways we never would have gotten without the show. As a fandom who grew up with the lessons of adaptability and inclusivity from the original show, we should try to love this new version as just that, its own version.\\n\\nI'm utterly excited to rewatch and for a second season!! If you've made it this far, thanks for reading :)\",\n",
       " \"I wanted to like this show so bad but unfortunately I couldn't. The first episode was decent but soon after we encounter a lot of examples of bad and stiff acting that just don't make the scenes or the whole show flow and it really does affect your enjoyment of it. Most of the visuals are pretty good, the location cgi designs and the creature designs were great and bending vfxs weren't too bad either. The final avatar state scene was actually pretty well made which impressed me. Still, because of the way the story was developed and the poor performances I lost interest and probably wouldn't watch season 2.\",\n",
       " 'I didn\\'t have high expectations after the 2010 movie adaption but this exceeded all expectations. I was hooked by ep 1. The cast is finally accurate (love the cast), and the visuals are stunning! Everytime a new location is showed I just go \"WOW\"!\\n\\nIt\\'s extremely funny and not stiff at ALL. I think the show manages to balance seriousness with comedy amazingly. Sokka and Zuko are hilarious and play their characters so so well. I also love the genuine relationship between Zuko and Iroh. Katara and Aang are just adorable and we love them! Even little side characters like the guys who sing secret tunnel or cabbage guy, it\\'s perfect. I even like how some of the bad guys can still make me laugh. That\\'s when I know something is well written, when bad guys can crack jokes through sarcasm. I can go on and on about the cast and characters, but that would take all day so let me move on.\\n\\nThe characters have a lot of depth and it\\'s not just all happy. Some scenes give me chills, tears even.\\n\\nAnd the story flows along and doesn\\'t feel forced. I watched the cartoon avatar around 2 years ago in 2022 I think, and I\\'ve forgotten most of it, but everytime something happens in the live action I am immediately reminded. Each episode contains core story and gives chronological progression accurately. I love small details that reference the cartoon like Aang\\'s air bending move where he floats on a ball and crashes into a rock, Jet with the little stick in his mouth (my sister and I litteraly screamed when that happend).\\n\\nThere\\'s not a moment where I feel bored because I love avatar the cartoon and this is it, it\\'s litteraly a perfect live action. This show is really great and out of all the shows I\\'ve seen on Netflix, this one has to be in my top 5! Well done guys, can\\'t wait to see more of this. I just know this one took a lot of effort and the cast and crew really outdone themselves.',\n",
       " 'The story is fantastic, the characters already established are fantastic, it has a Netflix sized budget/production at its disposal, it even has a predecessor to look towards in terms of what not to do to be better and yet the acting of the younger characters is what really holds this show from being great. The script also is wooden at times and over explains rather than shows you that emotion, payoff, etc. Every episode had its moment to shine and some did while others felt like it was being rushed, made, or acted by mediocrity. I sure hope they focus on getting the younger cast to ask more authentic rather than sounding like they are reciting lines for a play. Fingers crossed!',\n",
       " 'I see several negative reviews, mainly from people comparing this new series to the original animated series (let\\'s pretend that horrible motion picture misstep did not occur), but recreating the animated version scene-by-scene in a live action production would be as stupid as recreating Hitchcock\\'s \"Psycho\" scene-by-scene....\\n\\nOh, wait....someone actually did that, didn\\'t they? And see how well THAT turned out?\\n\\nI greatly enjoyed the original Nickelodeon series, and we have re-watched it many times, so it was with some trepidation that we began watching this series. It quickly became apparent that the people involved with this new series have the same affection for the original as we do. The casting is spot-on (although I do miss Mako\\'s grown as Uncle Iroh), the storyline rings true, the performances are outstanding, and the effects - which bring \"bending\" to life - are fabulous.\\n\\nThe only problem: the wait for the next season of episodes. One of my primary gauges of success for a motion picture or a series is whether I am wishing for more at the conclusion (still wishing for a sequel to \"Master And Commander\"!); this first season definitely \"set the hook\" and has us wanting more!',\n",

The original writers had a fight wt netflix about not following their stories.\\n\\nStill, it was definitely above average in everything. Sure i wish they would have followed the original anime , but that would be so many episodes,wt effects and crew, hard to make it profitable.\\n\\nI think they will make more seasons to complete the story but the kids and teenage actors will grow n change a lot, not sure how that will effect like a season 3, maybe the avatar will have facial hair ha ha.\\n\\nSeriously, for all the complains it get on imdb, and short 8 episodes(they should have go for 13), i would recommend this series to all lovers of fantasy and magic.

       " \"I thoroughly enjoyed the series and believe that people are overly critical of it. The original cartoon set incredibly high expectations, but it's important to recognize that the cartoon and the current adaptation have different formats. The cartoon was structured in an episodic manner, where each episode could be enjoyed on its own. However, when translating that to a serialized Netflix narrative, it becomes challenging to maintain the same level of childlike charm that some found in Book 1. Despite this, I believe the creators did an excellent job of serializing the story while still incorporating elements from the original cartoon, including some of the filler stories. It's crucial to understand that this is an adaptation of the original story, and as such, there will naturally be narrative differences. Ultimately, it's still Avatar at its core. I encourage you to give it a chance and approach it with an open mind. You'll find numerous instances where they reference other episodes, elements from the comics, and even Korra. Rest assured, the people behind the show are genuine fans themselves.\",\n",

Of course only season one has been remade and it is gonna be a while for season 2 of 3.\\n\\nThe casting can be compared to the casting of \"Stranger Things\" (2016). An all young cast with upcoming actors who will be in the hands of Netflix for the foreseeable future. I myself have little to no comments on the cast, they are all doing an incredible job and i can\\'t wait to see more of them on my screen.\\n\\nIt has always been hard to remake an already beloved show that barely has any flaws, they tried to do this with \"The Last Airbender\" (2010) but this was a big flop and did not do well. I am really glad they did not give up on doing this and tried again. They just did so much better this time around.\\n\\nEverything looked really well done, the visual and practical effects were amazing and they really brought the world of Avatar: the last airbender alive.\\n\\nOne of my favorite things about this show was the music. Takeshi Furukawa did such an amazing job, using little bits and pieces from the original show it brought tears to my eyes sometimes.

       " 'I did not finish this show. I watched the first two episodes before quitting. Thus, I am not giving it a number score. This is one of the most lifeless, passionless shows I\\'ve ever seen. This was not made because someone had a vision for what a live action Last Airbender should look like, this was made to capitalize on how popular the cartoon became once it went to Netflix. The acting is bad, the costumes look bad, the effects are mostly bad, and it has some incredibly goofy moments. The raid on the air temple in the beginning have a few, one where fire benders fly up a cliff, which looks like nuclear warheads launching. Another in which an air bender creates a tornado, only for fire benders to light said tornado and the air bender comically screams. Another huge issue is the order in which the story is told. Whoever wrote this probably saw Pulp Fiction and said \"why is it all out of order?\" Having the monks reveal to Aang that he\\'s the avatar on top of showing the air temple raid immediately raise the stakes higher than they should be. Part of what made the beginning of the original series great was the reveal that the air genders were all dead, it seamlessly introduced grim elements into a series that had previously been entirely lighthearted. Also there\\'s this weird issue with fire bending where it basically functions like air. People will get engulfed in flames, only to be shown with slightly tattered clothes and dirt on their face. I know the show isn\\'t looking to be crazy violent but some amount of realism there would be an improvement. I don\\'t plan on finishing this series, but from what I hear it at least doesn\\'t completely butcher the source material like the previous live action movie did. But that doesn\\'t mean you should watch this. Half of what makes the cartoon series so great is that is was animated, and trying to translate that energy into live action was what made this and the live action movie feel so awkward.',\n",
       " \"I really enjoyed how Netflix adapted One Piece so I thought this would be good in good hands. I hate to admit this, but I actually prefer the movie from 2010 and that's not saying much. It's not the worst thing I've seen, but the acting from the majority of the cast, including the leads, leaves much to be desired. The CGI and costumes also do not look as a movie over that is already done a decade old. I made it to episode 4 before deciding I was disappointed and turned it off. I didn't hate it, but it was serving as background noise as I played in my phone. It was less than engaging, which is unfortunate, because it could have had the opportunity to have some food fight sequences and manipulation of the elements. Netflix missed the mark with this one.\",\n",

As the episodes progressed they got better and better. By ep4 they had me in happy tears. I give this show an 8/10. Good job guys.

I admire the different spin on some things, and how SOME of the bending looks and how they made an effort to make the characters look like their originals. Thankfully the rest of this just reminds us of how special and great the animated show was. What I hate about this: poor acting/performances, BAD CGI when Aang flies through the air and the \"camera\" shows him up close, how bad/dark/thick Aang\\'s eyebrows look, and how completely unexciting it is. My friends may watch more of this since they\\'re real Avatar nerds, but I\\'m feeling so meh about it. NOT the kind of show I feel like watching more of...and not really sorry about it.',\n",
       " \"1. Overall Plot - 9/10 The overall plot is pretty much the same from the cartoon. Little story details get changed or moved around, but nothing in a way that ruins it. It is all still very good.\\n\\nThey don't mention sozins comet as the time frame for the show like the cartoon does. This is because they have to account for the actors aging. So it's OK because there is a legit reason to do it.\\n\\n2. Entertainment / Engagement - 9/10 The whole show is very entertaining. The first episode is a bit boring and cheesy. But with every episode it just gets better and better.\\n\\nBecause it's the same overall story, so you know the outcome, but some of the details are changed, it's still engaging to watch, because it's still something new and fresh.\\n\\n3. Emotion / Investment in Story - 8/10 Zuko carries the emotion in this. His development, and how we learn and sympathize with his character is so good. They did a great job bringing his character into live action.\\n\\nOther characters do a good job showing their emotions, but nothing really makes you feel to much for them as much as Zuko.\\n\\nBecause of the things they change, it keeps you heavily invested, even knowing the outcome. Which I thing is great to keep people watching and wanting more.\\n\\n4. Theme and Depth of Story - 9/10 I'd say the theme of this season is determination and accepting who you are. We see this with almost all the main characters as they develop.\\n\\nThis story is super deep. Especially with Zuko. There is a lot to learn, and I'm excited about the future seasons.\\n\\n5. Characters - 8/10 They nailed most of the characters. Something to keep in mind with the characters is that this live action version isn't a kids show like the cartoon, so the characters are gonna inevitably be a little different. Azula was introduced early on in the season and plays a small part in the plot. This is a change from the cartoon, as she didn't appear until the last episode of the season. But I think they did a good job with it.\\n\\nThere's really only three problems I have with the characters. The first is Sokka. His character is by far the most different. He is a lot more serious, and makes a ton less jokes. But that is also part of it not being a kids show so I don't think it's terrible. And he still has his Sokka moments. I also wish he used his boomerang more since it's part of his iconic character.\\n\\nThe next is Admiral / Commander Zhao. His character is completely different. I think it's just the way the actor plays it, but he has a completely different demeanor to him. It is also changed a bit because he works with Azula, which doesn't happen in the cartoon. Keep in mind, that just because his character is changed a bit, doesn't mean it is bad. I still enjoyed it.\\n\\nThe third change I noticed was pretty small. It's with Aang. He spends most of the season not wanting to accept that he's the Avatar, or complaining that he failed ad the Avatar. While in the cartoon he just gets over it a lot sooner.\\n\\n6. Acting / Writing - 6/10 Most the actors do good, but not great. They don't do anything bad, but just don't do anything spectacular either.\\n\\nI actually think Zuko's actor nailed him. It might seem like he complains and whines too much, but that is how Zuko started out. He is just a moody teenager after all.\\n\\nAll the writing was pretty good. There was a few cringy and cheesy parts, but that was really only in the first few episodes.\\n\\n7a. Cinematography - 4/10 The usual Netflix cinematography. They just make everything so dark and grainy. And I hate that. Some scenes look to bland, while others look to busy as well.\\n\\nThe characters outfits look too new as well. Sometimes they just look out of place and too cartoony for the vibe of the show.\\n\\n7b. Choreography - 10/10 I'm adding this as a separate section because of how good it was. All of the bending looks freakin sick. I think they made it look as good as it can get. Especially when compared to the crappy bending in the movie.\\n\\n8. Score - 9/10 I love how they brought a lot of the original music back. The score of the cartoon is perfect and amazing. I just wish they used it a little bit more, and less of the new music. The new music is still good though.\\n\\n9. Editing / Pace - 9/10 They did a great job editing this. All of the fights are edited good, and feel intense. There is also some very cool transitional shots that I loved.\\n\\nThe pace is also very great. Because it's a live action, you cannot pace it the same as a cartoon. It just doesn't work. But they didn't cut anything you wouldn't want them too. This show feels like it was made by people who love the cartoon. So the pacing is great.\\n\\n10. VFX/Practical Effects - 8/10 All of the special effects are super good. All of the bending looks super real and cool.\\n\\nThe only thing that is noticeably bad is when Aang is in the Avatar State. They do some closeup shots of his face, and the CGI looks bad. It honestly looks like a videogame cutscene. But that's because it's a Netflix show, so it doesn't have the highest budget ever.\\n\\nAverage Score: 8.1/10\\n\\nMy Overall Rating and Final Thoughts: 8.7/10 I actually really liked this show. I think they did a good job of remaking it. If you think of it as a live action version of the cartoon, it's going to suck, and you'll hate it. But if you think of it as a fan that remade the series using all the same plot points and details in live action, then it is great. I am fine with how it is changed and in a bit of a different order from the original. At first I didn't like it, but then it got better. Episodes 4, 5, and 6 are so freakin good. If you like the cartoon then definitely give this a watch. Just have an open mind about it, because nothing will ever be as good as the original. And even if you don't like it at first, keep watching. It gets so much better.\",\n",
       " \"The series looks better than I ever imagined. They nailed the architecture and looks of each civilization exceptionally well, especially with the Air Nomads and the fire nation. Also they expanded the world with new stories which fitted in very well and were overall interesting for an avatar fan. The acting and characters of suko, iroh and general zaoh was convincing and made me wanna see more of them.\\n\\nBUT the main cast of Sokka, Katara and Aang came very short. They didn't get many scenes to bond or to show their friendship. Also we didn't see much of their personality's and traits. Their chemistry wasn't very convincing so I had a lot of problems believing that they had formed such a strong bond in such a short time.\\n\\nOverall this series is pretty good. It expands the aviator story in a positive way and interprets the story in a new way which I really liked.\",\n",
       " 'The series seemed kinda rushed despite being announced a couple of years ago. Weak actors, but nice special effects, it seems that they cared more about making cool visuals, and not really focusing on the story itself, a huge letdown. Even the humor is weak. The movie did a better job than this series, and even the movie was a huge letdown. I watched all of the episodes at the course of an evening/night, and I wouldnt even give it a second watch, the animated series is way more enjoyable and actually rewatchable\\n\\nThe cartoon does a way better job and actually uses correct timelines unlike the live action series.',\n",
       " 'Seeing a rating of 7.5 honestly got my hopes up, I thought that similar to One Piece this will also be a solid show, which while not a 1to1 copy of the source, will be a solid retelling.\\n\\nWhile this is a vast improvement over the older attempts at Avatar the Last Airbender, The fight scenes are great, well choreographed. Couple that with decent CGI and you get a very fun show. However, where it falls flat is choosing which parts to show and pace things properly. The acting is also absolutely abysmal, I find it hard to believe they could not find a more talented lead child actor with how many people start taking lessons early nowadays. The dialogues are also written very poorly. There seems to be a real disconnect between the teams and quality of people working behind them.\\n\\nCould it be worse? Sure. However, it is also not deserving of being called good. It is your average middle of the pack retelling of a famous media piece.',\n",

Apart from watching all of the world events unfolding in our day and age, this was a nice escape departure. Not everyone will love or appreciate what it takes to create such production. Imagine re-creating \"Speed Racer\" in live action. You\\'d hate it, right? Spritle and Chimpkin wouldn\\'t ever be \"funny enough\" or the ubiquitous \"the front circular saws on the Mach-5 can\\'t really cut trees like that\"...

There are true moments that brings tears to my eyes.

Some 1 star ratings because they saw the trailer and the skin tone of Sokka and Katara were too pale and not enough diversity, so they decided to give the low rating without even bothered watching the series, this is just another level of ignorance and says it all. They are certainly open to their opinions, but it's like having a sniff of your food without tasting it and just throw it away, unbelievable.\",\n",
       " \"Avatar: The Last Airbender Netflix version is a bit of a mixed bag; on one hand it fails to capture the magic of the original series, on the other hand it seems to stay very loyal to the source material from first watch. The best way to look at this show is from an open mind, there is no other way.\\n\\nLet's dive into the world of Avatar by examining pros and cons, we'll focus on the pros first: The visual effects are stunning and look most impressive, same for the entire world and locations created from story board to screen. In general everything that has to do with the surroundings is at a most high level and I appreciate the care for detail.\\n\\nIn terms of story, it seems the creators decided to go with a 'Game of Thrones' approach: political games, schemes and backstabbing, wars and careful planning. I for once am in favor of this approach and believe it fits well the world of Avatar (after all, there is war in the show, people die).\\n\\nZuko's arc is very well crafted, mostly because it is the most interesting of the show (both original and Netflix). From being a banished prince to a man and leader of his own destiny. Dallas Liu portrays him very well and overall it seems he's the only character amongst the others who wasn't harmed by the script.\\n\\nThere are other good things to say about the show but for now we'll move to the cons: The biggest problem the show suffers from is that the creators focus mainly on the story and not the characters. In the original series, you had many filler episodes that focused on the dynamics: the episode Tales of Ba Sing Se, when the Gaang get lost in the caves with the group of hippies; Zuko and Azula going on a summer vacation with their friends.\\n\\nYou have many examples of character dynamics; Katara and Toph arguing, Zuko and uncle Iroh on the run throughout Book 2. There are Also moments when the characters are just acting silly. I feel all those little dynamics were absent throughout the show it could have added much more depth.\\n\\nBecause there were no filler episodes, there was no real chance at diving into the characters, after all Aang, Katara and Sokka are basically kids, so why not show them as kids having fun? ATLA is a show about kids on a journey, about friendship. Imagine the movie 'Stand by me' only at war times.\\n\\nAnother big problem the show suffers from is the pacing, this season alone is only 8 episodes, for a show like Avatar it is way too rushed. In one episode alone we were introduced to King Bumi, Jet and The Mechanist. I know Netflix couldn't make a full season of 20 episodes of live action ATLA. It's like demanding a live action version of One Piece with 100 episodes each season - in terms of budget and production it is impossible. Even a 10- or 12- part season would have been fine. I really don't see the reason to rush the story and cut corners.\\n\\nIn conclusion, I feel this show overall is a fair adaptation and possibly the best version of ATLA we could have got in live action. If Netflix wants this show to really succeed, they are going to have to put more effort in the script and characters, as of now this series is far from reaching the same level of magic the original show possessed.\",\n",
       " \"Everything is good, although there are still some things that I feel are not quite right, such as the players who play Azula, Mai, and Ty Lee look like middle school students who like to gossip. There are several scenes that in the animation look important but in the live action version they appear, such as when Aang first became an avatar in the water and when Aang went to the Avatar Roku temple and told the world that the avatar had returned as a form of hope for peace, I also really liked it. Suki's character has good chemistry with Sokka and can't wait to see him again in the next story. Hopefully this live action version of Avatar TLA will be even better in the next story.🌊🌏🔥💨\",\n",
       " \"To start off, I don't necessarily hate the show. It was created for people who have not watched the original story, that's the vibe I got.\\n\\nOne of the things that definitely bothered me was the acting. They should've not rushed the whole production and instead provided these child actors with lessons prior to having them act in a high budget show. They had potential but unfortunately, I guess that did not matter. You would have to hope to see some good acting. I believe only few actors those who were not primarily the main characters, were doing a swell job. For instance, like Bumi - the actor who portrays him is already an established actor, and he did an amazing job.\\n\\nAnother unnecessary change was the story of Omashu, now if you watch the original show, it is between a man and women - but here for some reason, it is a story between two women. Priorities, I guess.\\n\\nThis show storytelling could've been better, but it explains why the creators left.\\n\\nHowever, the effects and visual is just incredible! It makes you believe what you see could've actually what the world in Avatar could've been.\\n\\nIf I were to say, I think watching the cartoon is definitely way better. However, this is not horrible but also not the best, they could've offered better.\",\n",
       " \"Growing up, I never watched anime. I started of by watching this one when i was like 18, i loved it. It was amazing. The characters and story was so well written. But that's it, this show is for kids. It's about kids going on an adventure to stop the fire king to take over the world. Which in my opinion is like all anime's. They are trying to make this like the one piece live action and it sucks cause this show will never be as good as that one.\\n\\nThey tried, but flopped heavy with this tv show. If you really want a good anime or good show to watch, go watch the live action one piece. It is way more accurately represented and the acting, cgi, everything just better. This show is for children and it should be just for that.\",\n",
       " \"Just finished binge watching the tv series. It had the big budget and production as i expected and it was one of the best and i think they tried to make their own vision of the series come to life but my big fat question to the creator is that why deviate from the source material at all. You could have met with a great review if you had just sticked to the script . I mean where is the ang's funniness and comical presence that he had shown from the very first scene when he said to katara that ' would you go to penguin sailing with me ' and in the very next episode he just did with katara. Where is the saka's goofied mixed reply whenever he was in scene in the anime . Where are the mini adventures that were unrelated to the mission at all. I mean you literally had a video script for this . I am happpy to have got the live action version but please and please try to stick to the anime script. Just to make myself happy and wash down the little disappointment from this series you made me again binge watch the anime version.\",\n",
       " 'The effects are great, performances are great, production design (blue screens/Mandalorian background tech) is great. If you\\'ve never watched anything from this IP before, you\\'re sure to have a good time.\\n\\nAs a fan of the old series, each character feels very familiar in this adaptation, so for that I praise the casting department. However, I do feel like this series did almost too much fan service. They were too afraid to make any bold new attempts in its storytelling or directorial style. It\\'s all too familiar, making me wonder... why was it rebooted in the first place if they were gonna go this route? It all just feels like the Lion King \"live-action\" film, which also didn\\'t need to be made.\\n\\nAll this series did was make me want to rewatch the animated series again, because if the live-action series continues this way, tonally speaking, there\\'s no way it will even attempt to capture the charm and artistry of its predecessor. The original Nickelodeon show has aged all too well for it to warrant a remake, even one as shiny this one.\\n\\nBut hey, Netty\\'s version, while lacking substance, is still a good time. Give it a go.',\n",
       " 'Even before I watched the first episode, I had been saying it during the teasers and trailers that it should not mess up the humor because the original animation was so \"lively\" because of just that. Now after watching the disappointing first season, I can rightly say - most cookie points are lost just because of the humor.\\n\\nThe storyline wiggles at most places. Even when you try to shut the original and watch this Live Action as a new piece, characters come and go as if they are \"placed\" in the show just to give them a tribute or an honorable mention. Zhao, Bumi, The Mechanist, Jet & the Freedom Fighters, Mai, Tai Lee, Suki, Avatar Kyoshi, and other secondary characters are just there serving no purpose, sometimes making no sense also. Revealing Fire Lord Ozai was a huge risk, since he was seen in the teaser too, and now having Azula and Ozai not just seen, but also serving no purpose has made Zuko\\'s storyline blotched.\\n\\nThe White Lotus society carries a big part in the original, and here, Iroh and Bumi (ironically, together) yet don\\'t even acknowledge each other is just plain bad writing. Story of Oma and Shu, the lack of urgency of Winter Solstice, the lack of built up for up Avatar Roku, Aapa\\'s connection with Aang, everything feels haywire. Even if you close the animated chapter, and try to watch this as a separate entity, it falls flat on its face.\\n\\nMaybe Dallas Liu as Zuko fares well since he is the most driven, and even sounds like Dante Basco from the original. Ian Ousley as Sokka is watchable, bearable but his character is just plain boring. Worst are the leads, Gordon Cormier as Aang, and Kiawentiio as Katara - they lack the zeal, their character arcs look confusing, and they don\\'t behave like children but robotic adults.\\n\\nI could find little or no saving grace for this. Fight sequences are sporadic and forced, and the \"Avatar Culture\" that all of us Arrowheads are so acquainted with, is tainted. I have had enough of these Live Action, NO SEASON 2 PLEASE!',\n",

The bending looks beautiful and some of the fight scenes were even better than in the animation, the story line works and sets season 2 up perfectly. It's not as good as the animation but nobody excepted that anyway, this show deserves so much credit for bringing a beloved show to life. Some of the hate on this show is ridiculous, Avatar is not for everyone but I love it and a lot of people can agree with me. I really hope this show does well and I hope we get a season 2 because all the true Avatar fans deserve it.\",\n",

Nothing feels natural and nothing makes me feel compelled to like these characters except for the fact that they are playing the parts of my beloved Animate Characters.\\n\\nI will give some props to the Actor who played Sokka. He was the only one that came off as at least trying hard from the start to work with the Humorless material. I did warm up to the Zuko character a bit but the original Zuko voice and characters are so Iconic that it was hard to get use to the new version of him.\\n\\nMost of the older actors were great, I especially felt like I got back the closest version of Iroh that I could hope for.\\n\\nI see no way they can fix this show short of recasting and getting new writers.

Sakka and Ang both look exactly like his anime character, down to the expressions on Sakkas forehead. The bad guys uncle was also perfectly cast.

His quest for peace involves thwarting the sinister schemes of the Fire Nation.\\n\\nThis adaptation endeavors to capture the essence of the animated series while introducing fresh elements and narratives, although achieving perfect balance isn't always attainable.\\n\\nOn a positive note, this adaptation dazzles with breathtaking visuals and effects, showcasing a visually stunning world. The fight scenes are meticulously crafted, and although not always showcasing the diverse fighting styles of the animated series, the choreography, and presentation remain commendable.\\n\\nChange is not always accepted, especially when not done well or not being grounded in logical reasoning, and this is probably the biggest problem with this adaptation. The story told here has been reworked. New materials have been added; if stories aren't merged, they're imagined differently, and sometimes some storylines are tossed out. The most egregious is when the new storylines aren't followed through and forgotten. Some of the new materials here are good, for example, the backstory given to Zuko's character, but most will have audiences griping.\\n\\nAnother element that sticks out is the portrayal of some characters. Katara here is stripped entirely of the essence she had in the animated series, and calling her a caricature seems like praise. While it's refreshing to see Azula introduced early on, her ruthless and cunning demeanor doesn't fully translate. Zuko's character, on the other hand, receives the most authentic portrayal, capturing all the qualities that made him beloved, and perhaps even enhancing them\\n\\nThere are other minor flaws to note. The choice of wigs for certain characters and how they're installed is poor. Dialogue is poor and sometimes infused with overdrawn expositions. Another gripe here is that it seems like fun has been sucked out of this adaptation, the characters hurry from location to location and ultimately leave comedy on the chopping block.\\n\\nIn conclusion, while it may fall short of the masterpiece that is the animated series and evoke constant comparisons, this adaptation represents a positive step forward following the forgettable movie that preceded it.\\n\\n6/10.\",\n",

Well, you don\\'t do it by taking a pile of cash and producing one of the worst movies in history. Shame on you, M. Night Shyamalan. This current live action adaption clearly lacks the \"secret sauce\" that touched so many hearts, young and old, in the original. However, an oasis in a desert is still not to be spurned.

The one thing this show did right was the effects. The characters are unlovable and unfunny. Most Characters are not anything like how they are in the cartoon. This is most true for uncle Iroh; they did him so dirty. Iroh is the polar opposite of how he is in the original. Sokka is alright; Zuko is alright. Aang is unfunny and just bad at acting. Katara isnt hot headed enough. Overall this is one of the worst possible outcomes of this tv show. Unlovable characters and bad acting.\",\n",
       " \"This series is 1000 times better than that movie. It doesn't give the same feeling as the cartoon but it offers so much more. Am I the only one who is getting crazy happy just to see our bold monk. By the way the cast seems ok and they might be better maybe the aang but he captures the essence of the role and as for fire nation they are so on point. I liked this show and I advise everyone to see it. Please don't hate on new tv series they are only made because we love the first one so much. After all this is not a failed experiment of the movie this is is much more. Sticks to story and ads more things that makes it interesting.\",\n",

I truly loved the movie, the actors played much better, the music was much better.\\n\\nSometimes, I am amazed by how viewers judge the movies or series that even had a long tenured success.\\n\\nIn this series, even the boy that plays the Avatar is not charismatic at all, I am not convinced by his playing. The only character I liked was Katara's.\\n\\nThe dialogues like the spirit, it is so boring sometimes. It was so hard for me to continue watching episode by episode. I resisted only because I wanted to be able to leave a fair review and make justice to the movie.\",\n",
       " \"I thought it was over for any live action version of avatar when I saw the terrible 2010 movie. It was bland and left a bad taste in my mouth. But this show.. It actually has seasoning. This is avatar, at least as well as it can be portrayed as a live action.\\n\\nWe were definitely let down in the past, but let's be reasonable about this show. It's in my opinion unfair to judge the new remake so quickly and dismiss any new version of a live action based off of a past failure. I also know we tend to hype things up before it ever releases and set impossible expectations for the creators of the show.\\n\\nThis show deserves way more credit for how accurately it adapted to the nickelodeon cartoon we all love. If they had to remake it again, I don't think there would be anything better to incorporate that this show didn't already think of. They remade core episodes in the correct order and did it so graciously. This felt very similar to the cartoon. The longer you get into the story, the more you don't want it to end. With the old movie, everything was rushed or even narrated.\\n\\nThe cast... I mean seriously, where did they find the real life sokka! It's like he came out of the cartoon. Aang is an adorable character and the actor played the role very well. Zuko, Katara, honestly just everyone was perfectly casted. Even small background characters like the cabbage man made his comeback. The wardrobe, effects and scenery, just brilliantly done. Chef's freaking kiss. This show felt like watching the old cartoon again in a fresh light. I appreciate how funny, emotional, and even terrifying this show is. It didn't feel like it's made just for kids, but also for the fans who grew up with it.\\n\\nI am truly excited about this show and hope we get to see more of it.\",\n",
       " \"I mean, the show is good enough. It doesn't fail it's fans, sticks to the main story line and at least tries to recreate the charm of the animated version. However, there is a reason why certain stories better translate through animation and not live action. It's about the suspension of disbelief.\\n\\nMost of the characters come across more like cosplayers, look very distinct from another, each having their defining features much like animated characters would. But in real life it just looks cheap, too pretty. The characters don't feel like lived characters, if that makes sense.\\n\\nThe dialogue can also be very stiff and stale. Sometimes the effects look rather cheap, but I don't really mind. It is only minor things. When the big fights happen and bending is involved, the effects look really good. Also really brutal (esp. During the air temple attack and that one scene in the fire lord's throne room).\\n\\nI also found most of the actors did a good job: Iroh, Zuko, Suki, Azula. I also found myself chuckle at times when Sokka had some one-liners, but overall, the acting is... meh.\\n\\nI think it is impossible to view this show apart from the animated series and the live action movie that shall not be named. Compared to the latter it is liquid gold, but next to the original series it kinda just comes across like a fan made project with a big budget.\\n\\nStill, it was respectful of the fans, shortened or combined the story beats but stuck to the main ones. It doesn't disappoint, but also doesn't prove why it should exist at all.\\n\\nI don't want to come across as someone who hates this show. I don't. But if I were to decide between rewatching this or the animated version, I will always pick the animated version.\",\n",
       " 'I like this show, no it isn\\'t exact to the animated series but that isn\\'t essentially a bad thing. It follows as close as possible with having a stellar look-a-like casting choice and you can tell the heart is there. Media change is probably the reason for the rushed development, they had to squeeze in the budget and time frame. Whereas on an animation you can draw what and who you like.\\n\\nI like to see this as more of a \"This is what it would look like to turn the animated series into live action\" and that\\'s what we got. The world of Avatar: The Last Airbender in stunning CGI and real people. You have to give it to the actors for really trying to resemble their animated versions, even if their dialog is a little wooden. The \\'Cabbage Guy\\' in episode 3 was more of a cameo gag but i understand why it was in there. The writers really tried to map the cartoon but it unfortunately comes with it\\'s problems. Same goes for most of the dialog from certain characters.\\n\\nMy point is, don\\'t let yourself get annoyed at the fact it isn\\'t copied (as someone said in another review) \"frame by frame\", because it would just be daft to. Media change changes all aspects, it\\'s not easy going from cartoon to live action, different rules apply. Different availabilities. Just sit back and enjoy some cool effects with still a good story. Remember this is an adaption, and it\\'s good. Much better than the movie from 2010.',\n",
       " \"This series is much much worse than the 2010 movie. Netflix had 8 hours to tell the same story and it managed to screw up. I feel like the movie brought more information in only 2 hours. Without mentioning better actors, dialogue and plot. It is quite impressive how little Netflix can do with so much money. And once again the viewers will have to wait god-knows-how-many years for the continuation. Every time I watch a Netflix series I feel like I'm being pranked, they keep me watching without ever bringing the show to an end. Pretty disappointing. It is worth watching, it is a great story. But don't buy into the 10/10 reviews, it is very very far from a 10.\",\n",
       " 'Its not very good but not the worst. The main issue was the dialogue felt forced and unnatural due to over exposition. This was the same problem as the 2010 movie and overall made most scenes a hard watch. Some positives would be the visuals as the costume and set design was impeccable. The world felt alive and they did a good job bringing the locations from the animated series to life. The directing and cinematography was also good however it felt very safe and was not inventive hence it did nothing out of the ordinary. Another flaw would be the pacing as it felt too rushed at times especially when getting to the north. In the animated series, the side stories helped with character development and that was lacking severely in the adaptation.',\n",

So glad they made a point of taking actors that weren't caucasian.\\n\\nAs with all movies in the fantasy field, the critics are so harsh. But as we can see from the general public, this is very well received.\\n\\nI'm on the 5th episode and I'm really hoping it keeps going and they make a second season out of this show. Really enjoying it, binging it! Keep it going!!\",\n",

But its just that if there wasn't the terrible movie to compare it to than this series would have been ranked lower for me. The acting and casting just missed the mark. Seemed like none of the actors were fans of the series and just learning the script for the first time. Everything seemed so robotic and all the fun and comedic feel was removed. Honestly the character choice for pretty much everyone just seemed off no one really felt like they fit the role they were playing. Which the exception of Fire Lord Ozai he was casted well. But Zuko and Azula were totally disappointing. I think of your a fan its still worth watching it will most likely be the best live action version we get but. Don't get your expectations up to high.\",\n",

I am so impressed with the show and I'm happy to see a show I've spent most of my life loving so beautifully executed. There are so many things they kept true to the animated series and the creative liberty they have taken does not go against the original content. I am actually pleased with the casting and love the Inuit representation.\\n\\nI cannot wait to see the other seasons of this show.\",\n",

The cast tries and if we hadn't seen ATLA & KORRA it would be okay. But the humor is absent, in addition to the whole thing just being chaotic and frenetic and disorganized. Skimming the best bits from a few episodes and trying to make the whole thing work just makes nothing work.\\n\\nOn the positive side, I believe Mako is smiling and nodding in approval at Paul Sun-Hyung Lee's performance.\\n\\nBy and large the show is just another lackluster, ho hum reimagining.\",\n",
       " \"They've changed many little things for no reason at all, Sokka has no soul, no jokes, no comments, no life. Who is the avatar? Katara or Aang? Cause she does literally everything, which makes no sense at all, this series should be named Avatar, the legend of katara. They made her stronger than aang and this makes no sense at all.\\n\\nWhat can we say if literally every single show made in those years are like that, the main character if it is a man, it's weak, can't do anything, it's a useless piece of flesh, but every single woman is THE SUPA STRONGA, dude, really, netflix should just close their doors and never touch anything again.\",\n",

I like that they kept the foundation and made interesting changes. Netflix in my eyes continues to deliver. The special effects are so realistic they definitely blew my mind. The story writing is fun definitely creative. This Ang doesn't hold back the show he enhanced the character and brought new life to the world of avatar. I've waited for a faithful adaptation and the live action that hit as hard as the original show and this without doubt is such a fun ride.\",\n",
       " \"I couldn't understand what most of the leading children were saying. Every line was delivered at a rapid clipped pace. Katara, aang, even kyoshi... Blurred dialogue delivery made the whole thing feel very amateurish. I needed subtitles to understand most of what was being said. Strangely, the subtitles added spaces between words that the actors did not provide. Lots of cringe. Zero fun. Also, I sat through 2 hours of this and didn't even chuckle once. Every element was rushed, the humor of the original was removed, and this live-action's reliance on amateurish live actors was a poor choice, given the talent of the chosen actors.\",\n",
       " \"The makeup looks amateurish, the physics of bending lack power, and the character development is a shadow of the orginal series. It takes itself too seriously and not seriously enough at the wrong times.\\n\\nA better effort than the Shamalan adaptation and at time enjoyable but it fails to capture the soul that made you fall in love with the characters. Some of the new additions are welcome and the need to mesh storylines is understandable but the series tries to bring themes that are developed over three seasons of ATLA to the forefront too early and Aang's character arch is not mature enough to handle it yet.\",\n",
       " 'Many positive reviews mention fans of the animation series having unrealistic shot for shot expectations as if that\\'s the reason for so many poor reviews. This misses the mark entirely.\\n\\nThe biggest issue holding the live action back is the frenetic pacing and exposition, combined with weak main character performances, specifically the Aang and Katara actors. The animation was able to bring to life multifaceted and flawed characters who grow in various ways throughout the series. The live action completely misses the mark here. Aang is solemn and melodramatic, completely lacking joy and fun. Katara is meek and feeble without ANY emotion. The writing is much to blame. The relentless plot advancement and tendency to \"tell\" instead of \"show\" doesn\\'t help. But even so, these actors don\\'t seem able to able to act the required range anyways.\\n\\nOg fans love the animated series because of the incredible character development. With that missing, it\\'s simply impossible to get emotionally invested in what\\'s portrayed. Visuals and CGI is great for the most part. If you are a fan of spectacle than I can see you enjoying this show. However, if you\\'re looking for more than beautiful sets and fight scenes you will be sorely disappointed.\\n\\nIt\\'s clear everyone involved deeply loved the source material and their effort is commendable. I do hope the series is renewed for another couple seasons. That said, Season 2 would benefit from slowing down the plot advancement pace by only tackling half the animated series book 2 with focus on giving longer dialogue scenes where we can become more emotionally invested in the characters.',\n",
       " \"I literally do not understand why people are being so critical. First off the casting is *chefs kiss* particularly sokka, iroh and bumi. The negative reviews are people who wanted this to be a word for word remake of the original. It was never going to be that. I mean it's pretty dang close to the og, like episode for episode. Including all major side characters!!! Yessss some stuff gets cut out but likeeeee it's fine. The best live action remake I've ever seen for sure.

The heart, philosophy, and humor are simply too special to ever match, as evidenced by the sequel series. But I did not go into this LA iteration with the ridiculous expectation of seeing a shot for shot remake of the original. Rather, this series finally delivered on what I have dreamed of for almost 20 years, a faithful, more mature, and ultimately fun adaptation for a beloved fantasy series delivered by a cast and crew that clearly hold as much respect and love for the series as the fans.',\n",
       " \"I had to give this a 10, simply because it deserves more than what many reviewers are giving it. The minor changes make sense, and if people are down scoring it because it's not the exact script from the cartoon, then they're delusional. The writers got rid of some side quests, fleshed out the characters a bit more, and added grit. I absolutely love the portrayals of the cast. Aang is top-notch. Sokka is brilliant. Katara is great. Zuko is wonderful. And Iroh, who is my favorite character in the animated series, gets better and better as each episode progresses.

The comparison should only be made to the original animated series, which is a work of art.\\n\\nThe new series misses everything that fans loved about the original series. It replaces it with a visual and unnecessary depiction of dark themes (to supposedly appear mature), and with endless, emotionless expository text. In the Netflix series, we are exposed to superficial characters who only reflect the stigma attached to the original character (and even here, the writers failed), and nothing beyond. The dialogue is thin and boring, the exposition is endless, emotionless, and logically flawed. In the original Avatar, every character had depth, emotion, logic, and comedy. Every character has a role, but they are not defined by that role alone. The characters are human. Throughout the original series, the characters develop and mature. The viewers are exposed to wonderfully written backstories, understanding their personalities. We see this through an excellent presentation of the story, not just a narrative text. In the original Avatar, there is development as a team (Team Avatar). In Netflix, each character lives in their own world! There\\'s no camaraderie, just a superficial connection between the characters, there\\'s nothing there! Sokka and Katara join Aang \"because they can\\'t go back home\" suddenly-??\\n\\nIn the original series, we have two full episodes (the first ones) that show the initial connection between the heroes, the conflict arising if Katara and Sokka leave home, and their commitment to save Aang after he sacrificed himself to protect their village. Only then does their grandmother realize their destiny to help the Avatar.\\n\\nNetflix lacks all of this. Katara and Sokka go to rescue Aang without explanation. Before all of that the grandmother somehow discovers Aang is the Avatar, and it adds nothing to the story depth. No one even acknowledges her. At best, this is lazy writing; at worst, it\\'s contempt for the viewer.\\n\\nAnd that\\'s just the first 5 minutes of the show, the rest is much worse.\\n\\n(I\\'m not comparing it to the depth of the story, so you won\\'t have spoilers, for the animated series of course)\\n\\nIn the Netflix series, they decided to take all the episodes, stories, and plot of season 1 (and even some of season 2, for some reason) of the original and turn them into a rotten vegetable salad. Nothing connects, unrelated things suddenly linked without logical reason. Everything is ruined. The result is that every character (remember, they were already given no chance by the writers to bond as a group) goes on a boring journey of their own, ending in especially childish and bland development, just so Netflix\\'s distorted plot could eventually resolve. It feels as if ChatGPT wrote the series based on ideas from the original.\\n\\nAll this before even discussing the cringeworthy acting (especially Katara, a terrible actress with strange and hesitant expressions), the generic Hollywood music (the original series had a unique, unforgettable soundtrack), and the shallow plot compared to the original.\\n\\nHowever, it seems that the actors (except for Katara and Uncle Iroh with childish acting) do try to do some justice to the show, but they received poor text with confusing directions about the emotions of the characters. Or they might not have had enough time to learn the scenes.\\n\\nThe actors mostly do look like the animated originals.\\n\\nThe casting is not bad; the execution is poor!\\n\\nThe graphics are amazing, but the bending (element manipulation) should have been faster. Watch the trailer at 1.5 speed to see how it\\'s supposed to be. (Or just watch the original!)\\n\\nAnyone who watches the new Avatar on Netflix without knowing the original Avatar will think it\\'s a good series. They might rate it between 5 and 7 if they\\'re really generous (and even that\\'s only for the graphics) and move on with their life.\\n\\nBut if you want a mature series, well-written, with depth, emotion, originality, and logic, a series that will touch your heart, watch the animated Avatar series of Nickelodeon.\\n\\nFor the Netflix Avatar: 3.5/10, just for the graphics and the attempt to bring an amazing and beloved story to life.',\n",

There're some episodes that are lower paced and more quirky, but they follow the original and sometime add to it with the visuals and more.\\n\\nPlease, let us fans get the rest of the saga!\\n\\nThe series only improves with each season!

Sure there were some iffy moments, like the constant exposition in episode 1 but I made it pass due to the fact that I knew that was for new viewers who haven't seen the Original series before which was always going to be needed and was always going to be annoying to those who already knew the story but that's okay and there were also some scenes to nitpick but not enough to take me out of the story 9.5/10.\",\n",

They\\'re trying something different and they\\'re doing it well, they\\'re giving side characters like lieutenant Jee and the earth bender who was in charge of transporting iroh more context which is something the og show never did. Is there bad? Yes but when is there a perfect show right off the bat. Just look at the show with the eyes of \"hey this show looks nice it\\'s about a world where people can control elements and one kid can control all 4\" that\\'s it. If you keep comparing a show to a show that\\'s 10/10 everything will look ass in comparison. So just look at it with fresh eyes.

The atmosphere is thrilling and moving. The outfits are great and so is the set design. The story feels a bit rushed but it wasn't a dealbreaker for me.\\n\\nThe humor of the characters is still there but of course less, but I understand that it is much easier to incorporate exaggarating facial expressions and comical moments in a cartoon than in this adaptation.\\n\\nI do feel like they should have focused more on the childish innocent side of aang rather than rushing him to be a mature protagonist.\",\n",
       " \"Agree with some reviews and don't agree with some. Any adaptation of this nature is difficult and this is not the best by far but definitely good and decent. Strangely I got connected to the antagonists more than protagonist performance, probably due to the script or character selection. But Zuko and Iroh has done great deal of justice, the way they play through emotions for every flashback is enthralling for a fantasy series. I can't find fault with fire lord ozai himself or other antagonist roles. Having said that the protagonists definitely grow on you as the series progresses. Please watch few episodes before making your judgment. It deserves least one sit through and definitely entertaining.\",\n",

Which is a shame because I do not believe it deserves it.\\n\\nFrom my point of view this show is extremely impressive. It is like watching a AAA film every episode. This is done better than a lot of 200 million dollar Marvel movies, it puts what Disney makes to shame. The production quality of this show is the best I have ever seen in any TV show. The story is good (8/10), the choreography and how they use bending power is fantastic (10/10), world building is fantastic(10/10). They have massive fantasy cities and large scales wars at the fraction of the budget of the rings of power. The battle scenes in this show put the battles in the wheel of time and rings of power to shame, which should ask the question what are the other studios doing with their budget??\\n\\nOverall, this show is very very good, if you are interested in a fantasy show I would definitely recommend this.',\n",

The characters, while visually interesting, didn\\'t have the same depth and connection that I think they should have.\\n\\nPacing was also a bit of a rollercoaster. Some parts in the middle felt like they dragged on, slowing down the overall momentum. On the other hand, some scenes, particularly towards the end, felt rushed, leaving me wanting more development and emotional payoff.\\n\\nWhile I appreciate the potential for further exploration, I think the show would have benefitted from a more conclusive finale that didn\\'t blatantly set up a sequel. It could have provided a stronger overall impact with a more definitive wrapping up of the story arc.\\n\\nOverall, for someone completely new to the Avatar universe, \"The Last Airbender\" offered some stunning visuals and exciting action. However, the lack of character depth and the uneven pacing held it back from reaching its full potential. I can see why fans of the original cartoon might be disappointed, but for newcomers like myself, it was a decent, visually impressive adventure with room for improvement.',\n",

By doing so they became the first successful anime live adaptation show.\\n\\nThe positive about this show is its visual and bending sequence. It looks pretty cool in live-action. I'm glad they used soundtracks from the original show.\\n\\nSo overall this show is below average and I hope they correct those mistakes if they make 2nd season. I hope they make an enjoyable 2nd season.\",\n",

It doesn't feel rushed or anything.\\n\\nThis adaptation is a solid 8-8.5/10.

If you look at the actual plot it's about inserting children's into a long and bloody war, of course live action is going to look and feel more intense.

       " 'It is difficult to adapt a beloved show. If the original is really great, in a sense, the adaptation can only be worse.\\n\\nThis adaptation is miles above the movie that-shall-not-be-named, but it still disappointed many fans. I understand that. Some of it is just nostalgia. The avatar animated show was amazing, but season 2 and 3 are when it really took off. Season 1 was good, with great moments, but not yet a masterpiece. So a lot of expectations were too high and probably unreachable.\\n\\nAt the same time, comparisons are unavoidable. The show was allowed to make changes: take a different tone, change the episode format, etc... But knowing the great source material that was available in the animated, some choices are still baffling.\\n\\nOverall, the show did many things really well. The visuals, first, were amazing, with few exceptions. From the sets and costumes to CGI landscapes and bending, it was really both beautiful and faithful to the world. The action was often good or great. Most importantly, it had its heart in the right place.\\n\\nThe issues start to appear in the plot. This show tried to keep many story beats from the original, but in only 8 episodes, that meant mashing together many plotlines together. This more often than not failed, rushing through too many things at once. The show was at its best when it let one a single plotline breath into a full episode. If future seasons are adapted, I hope they dare to cut more (or even better increase the episode count, even if this means higher budget).\\n\\nThe constant rush is probably part of the reason we never get to really enjoy the Gaang, either individually or as a group. We see too little of their dynamic, as they are often split apart to follow different plotlines. And individually, we simply have too little of them being them, instead focusing on them doing things to move along the dense plot. Their flaws are mostly removed, reducing their space to grow. Their personality is more often that not explained instead of being shown. Hearing \"I like goofing off\" does not quite give the same effect as actually seeing a character goofing off. Zuko and Iroh are the only ones to really get meaningful character moments. Since characters were arguably the strongest point of the original, it is sad to see this.\\n\\nAt the end, is it a pleasant show? Yes, I think so. But I don\\'t think the quality was here to bring new viewers to think \"this was a masterpiece\". For me, it is a solid 8. Once I removed my expectations, I enjoyed the show, and some episodes, episode 6 in particular, really gave me high hopes for the future.\\n\\nIf netflix greenlights more seasons, which I really hope, I think the potential is there. If the writers can learn from this season, give more time for our characters to shine, start showing instead of telling, and otherwise keep the visual quality and the obvious care they had for the show, I think we COULD have a masterpiece.',\n",

Big lack of kindness, compassion and solemnity. Fierce doesn't equal mean and agressive for Kyoshi. Kuruk is disturbed, not helpful.

If you are going to dub over actors who are literally speaking the lines on camera, it needs to be done FLAWLESSLY. Though I'm not even sure that this is dubbed? The voices and levels on the voices of the characters just sounds super bizarre and unnatural. It's literally so bad that the show is unwatchable. How did this get the green light? Am I taking crazy pills or does it sound like the actors are speaking from inside a low budget sound booth? I'm padding this review for length, sorry.\",\n",

Even The Great Divide is worth telling. They skipped so much. I mean, where is Jeong Jeong? The comedic element is almost negligible.\\n\\nI think it's very fast paced. And there are some major restructuring of storytelling which is achieved by taking shortcuts. It's like movie version of a detailed book. You lose so much in a movie but if you read the original book, you find so much more depth to every story. I can see why the original creators of the avatar universe parted ways from this project. They did make some changes to the story too. The fandom probably won't like those changes. Not major changes but ATLA fandom is very religious about the show. Like, penguin sledding is quite a significant event in a hindsight.\\n\\nThere won't be many surprises or plot twists for you if you watch the animated series after you watch the live action series. Actually same can be said about the live action series but the level of detail you get in the animated series makes it worth watching it first.\\n\\nActing is good for the most part. Visuals are great! Casting could have been better.\\n\\nAs a standalone series, this would have been rated a lot higher. So, there is surely a bias when reviewing this series, not just from me, but from the whole fandom. And I would say, rightfully so. We know what it could've been if done correctly. It only reflects how amazing this story and universe is, even when the whole story isn't told correctly, if that makes sense. As Zuko often says, all hope is lost (for future seasons).

I mean at the end of the season one, in one of the most epic scenes there is no music and feels like some ordinary accident is going on. The cast is terrible as well. I mean it seems like they have been forced to make it with those actresses and actors. Especially the actress playing princess of the fire nation is unbelievably awful in every aspect. The avatar is next and then with a little distance come others like Zuko and The Uncle. These bad feedbacks get amplified if you have seen the original animated series.

But they really surprised me. They changed juet enough to make it super fresh and not too much so that we still recognise it as an adaptation. I really don't care what people thinking about this , but I absolutely loved it ! Bravo !\",\n",
       " \"Although seemingly a high review for a show with more negatives than positives, I feel pretty comfortable rating season 1 with a 7.\\n\\nI can't exactly pinpoint any redeeming features aside from nostalgia towards the original animated series and huge and drawn out excitement over this shows release (which wasn't entirely 100% sabotaged, like some other live actions).\\n\\nTo start with I will go over what I did like about the show.. It was fairly accurate to its original content, by that I mean they didn't totally change or re-write things that have happened. What I actually immediately and much more frequently noticed was content being missing, rather than being inaccurate or revisionist. This is an overall plus to me, because one of the worst offenses (in my perspective) when creating a live action show based on cartoons, is when writers start changing things. It's offensive to the original creator and also egotistical to think they know better. This show wasn't so much a victim of that, not nearly as much as others. I felt it was true to the original - just not comprehensive or whole.\\n\\nNow for the bad..\\n\\nThe actors, or characters were ALL very bland, dry, and didn't really portray their cartoon equivalent very well at all. The closest character I felt to the original was probably Bumi who played a relatively small and undercut role. More on this later but Bumi entire story was cut short and parts are missing (unless are yet to come, in which case would be out of chronological order). It felt to me as though they made these characters more appealing to kids (or too PG) by removing any sense of identity and likeability. I can't really nail down the specific reasoning, but I just get the feeling by making these characters more kid friendly they took away any sense of identity and personality. This was specifically an issue with Aang, but also noticable with others such as Katara and Sokka. You get the sense of the characters Katara and Sakka are meant to be portraying (such as Kataras bossiness or Sakka's silliness), but they don't really get the desire effect. It's half hearted at best. After watching the entire series I still can't decide exactly say if this is a writing problem, directing problem or a casting problem..\\n\\nWithout any spoilers I will just say that whole storylines from the original are removed or heavily condensed from this series, I guess in order to make a more coherent storyline given the limited timeframe of episodes and trying to reach a certain point in the story by the end of the season. I personally think this along with the dry acting were the two biggest downfalls of the show.\\n\\nIt felt as if they tried to cover way too much of the Avatar storyline in too few episodes of this new show. It's like as if they wanted to get as much out there in the chance that they won't be able to make it any further (the show not being renewed). I don't really understand the point of this. It pretty much ruined the storytelling and character arcs up until this point. Not seeing certain arcs completely changes the way you see different characters or the way you feel about them. They also come off as 'less real' if possible, considering they are all fictional characters. More interestingly they waste time showing life for Aang before being frozen, which was never featured in the original. One place where scenes definitely could have been cut for more integral storylines that were cut.\\n\\nI think the show would have been better both in its current state, and in the future if they just took things more slowly. I think that season 1 should have ended somewhere around the time the southern water tribe was attacked, prior to the whole adventure even unfolding. For context - that was the end of episode 1. So realistically they covered what I think should have been an entire season in just one episode.. Why? Was it because they thought the show wouldn't make it to the end of the story otherwise? What other possible reason could they have? And wouldn't slowing things down given more job stability in the future? In other words, the longer they could have drawn the series out the more work they have for longer..\\n\\nIt's not just that things happen too fast. The problem lies in that whole storylines are condensed, removed and basically ruined. One part where this was extremely evident to me was the compacting of the story of the 'blue spirit'. In the cartoon there are several interactions before Aang finds out who it really is. In the live action he finds out way too soon which ruins the entire plot of that arc. There are several other instances of the same thing, basically every arc with some being worse offenders than others such as the sokka + princess Yue arc. You really would need to go over every character and their interactions to see what was missed.\\n\\nAlso they removed/cut very integral scenes - one that sticks out like a sore thumb is the (literally infamous) 'Yip Yip' scene from the animation. I have a hard time believing this wasn't at least filmed and ended up being cut.. This was absent from The Last Airbender live action - but funny enough got a reference in the recent animated series 'The Dragon Prince' having one of the characters jokingly call out 'Yip Yip' in order to get a dragon to fly.. and it works.\\n\\nGiven that I had been looking forward to this show coming out for literally years now I think that also adds to the disappointment, or created unreasonably high expectations.. Maybe not everyone followed so closely, but this show was originally announced in 2018, so from it's announcement took almost 6 years to produce. The longer you have to wait for something the better you expect it to be. Otherwise things come across as 'overhyped' which sadly to say I think the Avatar live action leans towards in my perspective.\\n\\nIt also hints at the next problem with this show.. Although there were strikes and other setbacks like covid during the making of this show - it took a really long time to come out with this first season. Not even renewed for a second season as of writing. So we are looking at quite a wait for a season 2 potentially. I can't exactly blame the show itself for this but I think it compounds the problem of rushing storylines... We wait all this time and you're going to miss stuff and rush through content?\\n\\nDespite the seemingly negative review - I still personally enjoyed it. I doubt I would recommend it to anyone who didn't watch the original cartoons, I don't think it is a good watch for people such as that. I think it provides the nostalgia for those that did watch the cartoon (and probably several run throughs at that). Even given all of that, I am personally looking forward to a potential season 2 still. Given the issues at hand there is still time and possibility to fix the mistakes - I don't have much optimism that will happen, but still gives you something to look forward to.\"]"

       "'I understand that adapting a cartoon series scene by scene into a live adaptation is impractical. However, removing the lead character\\'s pivotal arc, which was integral to the essence of the original story, weakens the storytelling. The Aang portrayed lacks the innocence and depth of the 12-year-old protagonist we grew to love; instead, he\\'s presented as a young adult novel archetype warrior.\\n\\nMoreover, the characters seem to lack the comedic traits that defined them, resulting in scenes that feel devoid of emotion and overly somber.\\n\\nThe direction feels stagnant, with characters rigidly placed and delivering exposition rather than engaging dynamically with the world around them.\\n\\nNumerous unnecessary changes detract from the impactful moments, surprising reveals, and character development that made the original series so compelling.\\n\\nWhile I appreciate the efforts put into the visuals and action sequences, they shouldn\\'t be the sole focus of a production with such a substantial budget. I\\'m too exhausted with these pointless live action remakes of animated classics to get angry anymore. This Netflix redo of AVATAR: THE LAST AIRBENDER is at best competent, with handsome production design and costuming. Storywise, it strips out the humor of the original, leaving us with grim imitations of the characters we so loved. The sadsack reimagining of the feisty Katara is particularly horrid.\\n\\nThe acting is spotty. Some of the performers are pretty good, but so many of the line readings come off like community theater. Where\\'s the passion?\\n\\nWhile not the fiasco the previous live action feature was, this new AVATAR is just pointless. Yeah it\\'s not bad, but why settle for not bad when the original show was great? I\\'d rather just rewatch the old one for the hundredth time. At long last, Netflix\\'s Avatar: The Last Airbender has arrived. And I must say, I didn\\'t necessarily care for it too much. This calls for the classic line: If it ain\\'t broke, don\\'t try to fix it.\\n\\nI wasn\\'t swayed one way or the other. I didn\\'t hate it, but I didn\\'t love it. It kind of just exists. I couldn\\'t help but compare everything in the show to the original cartoon. (One of the best TV shows ever in my book.) Everything was done in its shadow.\\n\\nAt one point I was watching with my brothers and we were like \"this is kind of mid. We should just watch the cartoon.\" And that\\'s what we did. I think that tells you all you need to know.\\n\\nI heard someone say that this was on par with Disney\\'s recent live action remakes. Mostly soulless remakes. And I would have to agree.\\n\\nThe best part of this show is the casting I would say. The acting is just ok though.\\n\\nOverall, I didn\\'t care too much for it. I really loved the animated Series of Avatar, watched it so many times.\\n\\nGood things : Although this season is much better than last flop movie but they missed so many things. CGI is much better, effects and fights are really good. Bending effects couldnt be better .\\n\\nBad things : The fun of characters was nowhere to be seen. Sokka was suppose to be a funny guy but they made him look so angry all the time. Same goes for bhoomi and Iroh.\\n\\nStory has been changed much enough that for person who never watched it wouldnt understand all of it.\\n\\nDialogues and script is so cringe at some places. Specially dialogues of kitara and sokka. Unnecessarily trying to fit the dialogues of animated series without setting up the whole script .\\n\\nSo its 6/10 for me. I know Avatar: The Last Airbender is one of the most popular and loved animated shows of all time. They even tried to make a movie about it back in 2010 the is universally panned. The animated series has a 9.4 rating here and the movie only a 4.0 so people have been hungry for a good live adaptation of the animated series for a long time. It\\'s finally here. It\\'s almost impossible to please everyone who liked the original animated series because everyone has their own expectations on how it should be and they hate when it differs even a little from the original. They don\\'t seem to understand how they don\\'t have the luxury of having unlimited episodes and get go as in depth as the original, it has to be adapted into only 8 episodes per season. I had no problem at all, I liked this series so much that I binged all 8 episodes in only 2 days. I just couldn\\'t stop watching and already looking forward to next season. As a longtime fan of \"Avatar: The Last Airbender,\" I approached Netflix\\'s adaptation with cautious optimism. Unfortunately, what I found was a series that fell short of capturing the magic and depth of the original.\\n\\nOne of the most glaring issues was the lackluster dialogue. Lines that were iconic in the original series were either altered beyond recognition or delivered with a lack of emotion. For example, the pivotal moment when Aang emerges from the iceberg and speaks to Katara lacked the sincerity and charm that made the scene memorable. Instead of the heartfelt exchange between two characters meeting for the first time, it felt forced and flat.\\n\\nAang: \"I need to ask you something. Please, come closer.\" Katara: \"What is it?\" Aang: \"Will you go penguin sledding with me?\"\\n\\nMoreover, the adaptation failed to capture the essence of the characters. Aang, Katara, and Sokka lacked the depth and development that made them so beloved in the original series. Instead of complex and nuanced personalities, they felt one-dimensional and uninspired.\\n\\nOverall, Netflix\\'s adaptation of \"Avatar: The Last Airbender\" missed the mark. While the visual effects were impressive and the production value was high, it ultimately failed to capture the heart and soul of the original series. Fans of the original will likely be disappointed by this lackluster adaptation.\\n\\nRating: 6/10. No misunderstanding, I\\'m loving the latest Netflix live action series. I\\'ve really liked One Piece, Yu-Yu Hakusho and Avatar, and I finally see that things are being done right.\\n\\nThe issue with Avatar is another: it\\'s born from a cult series that is very difficult to fill. On the one hand, it has effects that are sometimes very noticeable in terms of green screens. On the other hand, between chapter 3 and 6, so many stories are mixed together that it\\'s a literal mess. We have a good cast, but perhaps the weakest point is Ang himself during some moments. Chapter 2 was a delight, I really liked 7 and 8. It feels like there isn\\'t as much chemistry between the main trio and perhaps the Ang-Katara ship wasn\\'t seen at all during this season. The best thing for me is the Zuko and Ioh plot that develops very well. Well, that\\'s why the title of my review: given the original material, it can and should give more...I look forward to the next seasons. Avatar: The Last Airbender is based off the animated series of the same name. It takes place in a world that is divided into 4 different nations, each nation is made up of an element (Fire, Water, Air and Earth). The Avatar is the only one who can master all 4 elements and the one who brings balance between all the nations until one day the Fire Nation decides to invade. The Avatar is the only one who can stop them but he suddenly disappears. A hundred years later a new Avatar named, Aang, emerges. With some help from friends he must master the elements to bring peace and balance back to the world. I have to admit that I\\'ve never seen the animated series or movie so I went into this with no expectations or prior knowledge of the series. I\\'ve read good things and the trailer looked good so I gave it a shot. I\\'m glad I did because I really enjoyed it. I thought it was going to be more aimed to younger audiences but it\\'s enjoyable for everyone. First things first, they did a top notch job with visual effects. Bending techniques, the way the elements connect with the bodies of the characters, the places all look wonderful. They bring the world alive. However, that is not what ATLA is about. In order for the characters to have their development we need to see their interaction, we need to see their characters, that is why we love the characters in the cartoon. Here the characters are all over the place. There is no goofiness, they are all too serious which bothers.\\n\\nAlso, showing things subtly, inserting the message between the lines is the strength of the cartoon. Here they deliver ling winded, empty, and bland speeches that do not move us. Overall i enjoyed the show. The visual FX is a spectacle to watch and is rather nicely executed. The backdrops and sets were all very well done. The characters themselves give tribute the original story and characters but that is there my problems with the show begins.\\n\\nMy biggest disappointment is that If you\\'ve watched the movie you could basically can skip this. The general story begins and ends the same.\\n\\nThe writing at times felt forced, bland and \"kinda pausing for reaction\" bad. The actors themselves i liked, but nothing memorable either.\\n\\nThe princess character and here entourage annoyed me to no end and the whole writing around her felt extremely forced. And while writing this part or this review I even lower my score from 7 to 6/10 so bad it was for me. I saw many episodes of the first season of the cartoon, but not all. Back when there were no streaming services so I needed to watch it on television when I passed by chaning the channels. Through the years I got parts of the first story but never the last episode of season 1. So I am aware of the story.\\n\\nI also saw the movie or movies, I am not sure how many there are. Het last one was not bad, it looks like this series. So I see the battle in the north again. But I must say, it was no problem. This series is very watchable. Sometimes you have amazing shots. But overall you can see the background faded and the foreground sharp and too much light, so you see it is fake. I think the really big amazing shots cost a lot of money and even that the other scens looking fake, it is still of a high quality. I think it is also combined with real shots.\\n\\nI mostly like the characters, but many times I think: there is something off. Like the parents or the crazy king. Also the acting can be a bit off, like it is too static. Just like the fake backgrounds. It looks to clinical.\\n\\nBut overall I believe the characters. The most important characters are believable for me. It also sometimes has the same sillynes as the original. The pace is also good, but I think sometimes it is going too fast. I think they take some shortcuts, but overall you get the main story. I enjoyed watching this. I am starting watching the original again, but then from season 2.\\n\\nSo I think there should be a season 2. I do not know if I like it after I just saw the original. But I saw many horrible adapation of books, games and animation. This is a very good take. It can be a bit better, bit more clever maybe. But this is solid. Amazing scenary and editing, it really gives off the vibe of the places in the original series. Also the didn\\'t spare in the usage of bending which is great.\\n\\nBut i was thrown a bit off by the threatical like acting, and the script. Maybe I need to get used to it. But it feels a bit forced how they act, like is very improbable to behave like that in reality. I guess they try to have similar reactions as the original characters in the show, but since they are cartoons its more acceptable. For a live action adaptation i would expect a bit more real/normal behaviour. But then again, i only watched one episode so far, so I\\'ll try to get use to it. The visuals are stunning - the effects are more impressive than I hoped. Unfortunately the dialogue leaves very little to the imagination. It is so literal! Good storytelling doesn\\'t involve explaining to the audience the beginning middle and end in the first 20 minutes. Did Chat-GPT write this?! This reeks of studio execs having to get this out and not hiring/ supporting good writers. It cheapens the acting, and you lose the emotion, passion, and energy. The animated show wasn\\'t about the sick fight scenes, but that\\'s likely all you\\'re gonna get from the live action.\\n\\nKid who plays Zuko absolutely nails it. He couldn\\'t have been cast better. Absolutely loved Avatar The Last Airbender on Netflix! I was glued to it. The actors are remarkable and the story is captivating and exciting. Although I personally felt that episode 5 and 6 could have been better visually, overall it was really good show. A must watch series! I can\\'t wait for season 2 & 3 to come out and see where it takes Aang and his friends next on the journey. Their friendship is so beautifully portrayed and the show transforms you into Aang\\'s world and you can truly relate to most of the characters. I loved the vibrant special effects and VFX. It is truly a well made show. It definitely needs to be marketed more. I noticed the show a few months after its release. First (1), the best arc that set the bar high in acting, casting, look and feel, storytelling, direction for Avatar is the Kyoshi Island arc (episode 2). They definitely got that right, 9.5/10. BRAVO! Whoever was involved there, give them a raise!! The worst and most disappointing arc was the Omashu arc (episode 3). They tried to do too much in one episode, it seemed rushed, as a result, it was just a mess, 4/10. I almost gave up watching the rest of the show because of episode 3. It was like the director, scriptwriters, editors took the day off. Should have just concentrated on a favorite arc and run upwards with it (my preferred would have been a way better King Bumi arc, drop the Jet, Teo and badger mole arcs). Or give them entire episodes each. I repeat, episode 3 was a mess, very disappointing. Second (2), everywhere else (that is not the Kyoshi island arc), the acting still needs a lot of improvement (which means the director needs to step up as well and bring it out of the actors). I rate the acting as follows: Aang (6), Katara (6) lacks emotion, Sokka (6) needs to be funnier/goofyer, Azula, Sozin, Ozai (5), Iroh (6). I think these actors did a way better job in portraying their characters: June (8), Zhao (8.5), Zuko (8.5), Avatar Kyoshi (9), Suki (9), Yukari (9). Third (3), the characters as they were presented have too many flaws. Azula is too weak rather than scary/powerful or frightening/intimidating. Maybe she could have played the part Toph better, but needs to act tougher. The old movie had a better Azula. The actress who played June (bounty hunter) would have made a way better Azula. Sozin was too friendly looking, doesn\\'t look like anyone who wants to conqueror anything. Ozai though they got the look right didn\\'t appear scary and overpowering/intimidating/bent on conquest. Mai and Tylee - almost invisible. Would have preferred more airtime and character development of them rather than Jet and Teo arc mess of episode 3. Fourth (4), the Northern Water Tribe arc, I thought it was just OK, the storytelling of animated version was just way better. The actors for Yue and Pakku, I think they did a good job, 7 each. Overall, I give the live action season a 7/10. Will watch season 2. I wasn\\'t intending to watch this, but after a while, there wasn\\'t anything else except the trashy Love is Blind nonsense and I decided to give this a go. The first few minutes were really B grade but it got much better and I ended up watching all episodes over two days. I loved the little kid who played Aang, and the two who played Katara and Sokka. Prince Zuko was also good. It was great to see so many Native Americans in the story. I will eagerly await season 2, which didn\\'t expect when I started watching it. If you want a straight forward fantasy filled story with great special effects, with no mind bending underlying themes, this one can be recommended. Since I can\\'t give halves , I was gunna give it an 8.6/10 but I rounded up to 9.\\n\\nActing was pretty good , some wooden scenes especially with Aang and Katara. But they\\'re expected since their newer actors Gordon literally has like only one scene before this show lol. But he does portray his innocence well and his acting is good for someone in his technically first role. Dallas (Zuko ) and Ian (Sokka ) were the real standouts\\n\\nThe production, in terms of cgi , sets and bending was overall really good. When Aang goes into the avatar state it generally does look kinda scary in a way. The fight scenes were prob my fav part , they do a great job at handling them , and I really that they did a fight scene that didn\\'t really feature much bending between 2 powerful benders\\n\\nThere is actually a lot of changes , some I might not like but i 100% get or just others I might have to fully understand on a rewatch\\n\\nBut even tho it\\'s def more serious then the original there\\'s still some of that innocence of the original\\'s\\n\\nI\\'ll say this tho , just give it a shot and come in with an open mind . If u come in expecting a straight 1 of 1, or for it to be as good as the original , then ur not gunna like it. I\\'ve seen some reviews where it\\'s just getting compared to the original, which wouldn\\'t really be that fair since the original is perfection to many ppl and others where u can tell ppl are just upset that it\\'s not a 1 of 1. And remember it\\'s an adaptation, not a remake. Viewed season one of this series over the period of a week or two. Me, a late-30\\'s male, along with my two sons. I watched the OG back in the day, and my two sons watched the entire OG series within the last year, so we are comparing directly to that. This adaptation was literally the best we could have hoped for.\\n\\nUnfortunately many people my age are comparing it to the original series (rightfully so), BUT they are forgetting to think about how they took the cartoon in as a CHILD compared to how they are taking this one in as a cynical adult. If you let go of those inhibitions and enjoy it for what it is, it is a truly solid piece of media.\\n\\nPLOT: 10/10, VISUALS: 9/10, AUDIO: 10/10, ACTING: 8/10, OVERALL: 10/10. As a big fan of the animated avatar, I can say that it\\'s not bad. It\\'s certainly better than the 2010 film but it\\'s also not as good as last year\\'s One Piece.\\n\\nThe CGI most of the time looks very good. Although there are a few scenes where it looks tragic. For example, Aang when he first enters avatar state looks like a plasticine human.\\n\\nThe animals and ghosts look beautiful. The fight scenes and the elements look cool too.\\n\\nAs for the actors, sometimes they play very stiff and totally emotionless and sometimes quite well. However, most of the time the actors really try, some come out better, some worse. The choice of actors for the roles is very good, almost all of them fit their roles, there are exceptions such as Princess Yue, Mai and King Bumi who to me do not fit the look of the characters.\\n\\nPlot changes obviously had to happen and it\\'s understandable because how would they pack over 20 episodes into 8? Some of the changes look cool and don\\'t really bother me. However, most of the changes surprise me a lot. The solution from the original would have looked much better and would have made more sense. Because of these changes, many of the characters are just different and do not reflect their character from the animation.\\n\\nWhy do they tell us everything? What? What for? Why? How? Instead of showing the character\\'s emotions, what motivates them, what their intentions are, what they are afraid of, they tell it all to the camera. I don\\'t understand why they treat the viewer like an idiot who can\\'t think for himself.\\n\\nLet\\'s hope the next season is better than this one. \"Avatar: The Last Airbender\" stands out as a masterful blend of animation, storytelling, and character development, captivating audiences of all ages. The series brilliantly intertwines humor, adventure, and profound themes, making it a timeless classic in the world of animated television.\\n\\nOne of the show\\'s strongest points is its richly developed characters. Aang, Katara, Sokka, Toph, and Zuko each embark on compelling personal journeys, evolving in ways that feel authentic and deeply satisfying. The series handles themes of friendship, responsibility, and redemption with a rare finesse, making viewers emotionally invested in the characters\\' fates.\\n\\nThe world-building in \"Avatar\" is exceptional, with each nation and culture meticulously crafted and distinct. The bending styles, inspired by various martial arts, add a unique and dynamic element to the action sequences, which are beautifully animated and choreographed.\\n\\nHowever, the series isn\\'t without its minor flaws. Some episodes in the first season feel a bit episodic and less engaging compared to the rest of the series. Additionally, while the series does a commendable job balancing light-hearted moments with serious themes, there are occasional tonal shifts that feel abrupt.\\n\\nDespite these minor issues, \"Avatar: The Last Airbender\" remains a groundbreaking series that pushes the boundaries of animated storytelling. Its blend of humor, heart, and action ensures it a lasting place in the hearts of its viewers, making it a must-watch for both young and old alike. This is more a refreshing adaptation of a source material that\\'s been delivered in recent times. Yes. Some of the acting is clunky and a bit goofy; however, watching the character dynamics with each other is, quite honestly, as close to the source that could be expected. Firebenders manifest fire. Waterbenders look like waterbenders. This can be watched, and you can still reminisce the animated adventure without feeling an injustice has been committed like a past adaptation that won\\'t be mentioned here.......ever again........personally, I don\\'t hover over films, shows, or media in general looking for inconsistencies. But as a causal viewer. This is perfectly imperfect. It captures the world of Avatar. I\\'m relieved of the dread of expecting some artist\\'s COMPLETE reimagining of a beloved source and elated to find something that is a retelling of it in a different medium. True to the source; true to the story. I appreciate this beyond words, and am excited to see it through. I am very loyal to the original animated series, and I understand why the creators of the original series decided to part ways on this adaptation. I was so angry when I started this, so many plot points and characters were mushed together to fit into less episodes that it left out huge development details, huge connections that become critical later in the storyline, and above all else, Aang\\'s story felt nothing like him. But then I switched perspectives, and made Zuko the main character in my head... and the whole thing changed. I was no longer mad about what was wrong with Aang\\'s story because it was not the necessary to the main characters plot. I was still very annoyed... but I wasn\\'t fuming and yelling at the TV (which I did, more than once). Is the original better? Hands down! But anyone who has seen the original should have already been prepared, knowing nothing will be better than what we all already loved. But because of how well the original handled character development, we all love Zuko just as much as we love Aang. So try watching it as if this is his story, it may make it easier for you to enjoy. Do I think this series can and should do better in the future at staying truer to the original plot? Absolutely. I am hoping they had to combine plot points in this season to get the show off the ground and get a bigger budget from Netflix on season two, and with a larger budget will stay truer to the story. I think it is worth watching, if only to see certain aspects come to life in live action. Just know there are parts you will be mad about. And give it a chance with Zuko in mind as the star. I usually type my review out long and detailed, but I love the OG show so much and after watching this adaptation I dont feel like bashing this just out of my love for the source material and cus this was bland.\\n\\nBut if I was to TL;DR it - Same ol same ol,\\n\\nSame old Netflix being Netflix just rushing motivations and character development scenes only to replace it with expository paragraph like stilted and flat dialogue just so they can get to that Key high points in the story without the actual soul of the journey.\\n\\nNo humor or joy in scenes that were taken from OG but twisted around to be exposition, and where there is humor it feels mean spirited or cringe or just humor in places that makes no sense and confuses you more than anything so you dont really find it funny.\\n\\nThis was disappointing and I feel empty.\\n\\nFar Better than the movie but that is a low bar to clear.\\n\\nEpisode 6,7,8 sat in a MF bullet train just to get to the end, they could have easily made book 1 into Two seasons to get the characters fleshed out and added more emotion to the journey.\\n\\nMaybe I should thank the stars that they didnt shove more into it like they did for Yu Yu Hakusho Live action where they rammed 60 Episodes into 5 live action.\\n\\nConclusion - People who have never seen this will love it since it is still adapting excellent and amazing storybeats from the OG. People who love the OG will not find any joy or soul in this. I was rolling my eyes at the first few minutes of dialogue after an \"exciting\" introductory scene that fell very flat. Immediately I was thinking \"uh oh, they have really failed to have the bending and battle effects read on screen.\" And then the dialogue goes on to give super unnecessary exposition.\\n\\nBut after the first 15 minutes or so, there was a lot to like. And it just grew each episode.\\n\\nI had to let go of some of the things we all deeply love about the original, but most of that was due to the live action medium versus animated. The way animation can stylize facial expressions and reactions, it really becomes a part of the characters. I\\'m thinking clearly of some of Sokka\\'s confused/frustrated faces from the original, just inherently hilarious.\\n\\nAnyway, I enjoyed it much more than I expected to. And I find myself very excited for the second and third seasons.\\n\\nMaybe even 8.5/10, but it does lose some points for the \"tell not show\" dialogue others have mentioned. A good friend of mine said it perfectly whilst we watched this show together: The show is the perfect addition(!) to the original show.\\n\\nIt provides so many parts that felt like they were missing and together they are simply perfect.\\n\\nIn my opinion the cast is doing a great job even though not all cast-choices were perfect (May for example) but this may change once they get more screentime.\\n\\nThere were so many great shots to enjoy, the music was great and overall I had alot of fun watching and enjoying the show.\\n\\nBut I would absolutely recommend to watch both as watching this alone might be a little bit confusing as it will feel like there is a lot of information missing. The original Avatar the last Airbender series is one of my favorites of all time. I remember watching it live week to week as a high schooler and thinking how weird it was I was so into a \"kids show\" on Nickelodeon. As I get older I\\'ve watched it a few more times and the more I watch it, the more I love it. It holds up in every aspect-the visuals, writing, character arcs and relationships amongst each other, humor, etc.\\n\\nSo when this show was announced I was skeptical because the movie stunk, and because the original series makes it a lot to live up to. I\\'ve now watched the whole first season and I have to say it exceeded my low expectations. As others have said, the visuals are incredible and some of the casting is actually very much on point. I thought Yue, Iroh, Zhao and Zuko in particular were all pretty great (However, other casting decisions were not good at all, but that wasn\\'t my main problem that I\\'ll get to later). I appreciated that they didn\\'t veer too far off the path of the first one in terms of plot (although they did rearrange some things that I thought were unnecessary and skipped some story sections I liked). Keep sticking to the source material in the future seasons!\\n\\nThe thing I think they missed on big time though, and hope to see changed in the coming seasons, is the brightness, levity, and humor of the original series. The first one walked the line really well of portraying at times very mature themes, but packaged them in a way that was very digestible and often times funny. The remake ditched that strategy almost completely, and the tone is over the top serious and at times even dark. I really couldn\\'t specifically believe how they portrayed Aang and Sokka as mostly serious characters, it felt wrong. They\\'re both kids, they don\\'t need to force them to act like adults, it\\'s weird. To add to that, Katara is portrayed timid this time, when in the original she was feisty and the voice of reason to two goofballs.\\n\\nIf you watch the original for just one episode after watching the live action version you see how radical the tone shift is, and I hope they don\\'t keep going in this direction, it could be so much better with a brighter and funnier tone, one that doesn\\'t take itself so seriously but still can tackle mature themes. That was one of the pieces that made the first one amazing. Costumes, special effects, music, and most of the casting was done really well. I think the actors did a great job with what they were given.\\n\\nI also didn\\'t mind that they combined storylines for time, but I feel like there was a lack of passion and pace that the original series had. As a huge fan of the original, I would have rather they just cut storyline in order for it to make sense and move more fluidly.\\n\\nAlso, I felt the heavy reliance on CGI was more about flexing the budget and less about being accurate to the source material. I would have loved to see more material sets.\\n\\nI wanted more time with Aang, Katara, and Sokka initially so we can get to know and love them as we did in the original series. They feel like strangers in this series and that\\'s sad to me. Also, not hating on the actress, but Katara\\'s character is completely different. I\\'m not sure why that choice was made. I miss the original character.\\n\\nIt\\'s worth watching, but I\\'m not going to be showing this to anyone in place of the original show. I hope if they make a season 2, they take notes. The subtle nuances are completely gone. The iconic moment where Katara gets emotional and breaks the ice is now replaced with her trying to bend the boat back? The complexity or story telling that sets up their arcs from children to adults is now not there. Why did Aang just go up there to think about stuff? HE RAN AWAY. The whole point of his journey is accepting responsibility and that begins with running away!\\n\\nAang\\'s character is told through other people instead of him being it. What is happening with the writing? I\\'m so frustrated watching this.\\n\\nThe only nice thing are the visuals, but apart from that it misses the heart and complexity that made the original iconic.\\n\\nAlso it\\'s just not funny. It is so scared to try to be offensive or say the wrong things or be disliked, it ended up being corporate and soulless. As a child the last air bender was one of my favorite mobvies, especially the first one that came up. I have not been invested much in the animation version of it but watching this new series has been an absolute enjoyment\\n\\nthe visuals are pretty nice, some scenes I was getting hyped on my seat because it was cool to watch your childhood favorite character in action. The actor has done an amazing job, the way he portrays the avatar as well as his charisma and character fits it perfectly and is very amusing to watch\\n\\nThe story is not something they could play with much but the story is pretty basic, I am here more for the visuals and the actions of the series.\\n\\nWould definitely recommend. Never having seen the animated version, I had no expectations going into this. I didn\\'t even know what the storyline was until I read it on Netflix. On viewing the first episode, I was totally hooked and binge watched the rest of the series. Here are my thoughts.\\n\\nThe good: Great visuals, great CGI, compelling story, and characters you can actually like (unlike so many shows these days). Add to that some very good action sequences and fast paced storytelling, and you pretty much have a recipe for success.\\n\\nThe bad: As with so many other shows, the writers do not seem to know how to write a great season finale... it wasn\\'t terrible, but it was unsatisfying. Additionally, the acting and dialog suffered at times, particularly with the Aang and the firebender princess (can\\'t remember her name).\\n\\nConclusion: I thought this was a very good effort and well worth watching. I\\'m looking forward to season two. I don\\'t even know why people are compare this with the film. The original comes from a cartoon. After seeing this I say just watch the original. They erased all the emotion and humor when making this series. Besides, people don\\'t talk logically and most things are cringe. The fire lord explains his entire plan and the character understands it after an hour. Not only did they remove the Aang\\'s breakdown from a scene, but they also made him look like someone who is afraid of taking responsibility and just wants to play games. What was important to him here was not playing games, but his friends. I still don\\'t understand how you completely deleted these emotional things. I don\\'t understand why they changed a perfect script. If you want something more mature and something that have humor, different emotions, watch the original. Netflix should give us new things instead of ruining good things. I can see that a lot of people attacking this series of Avatar The Last Airbender. There are even people who criticized the series even before its release due to the disastrous series that was released in 2010. On my part as a fan of the Avatar The Legend of Aang series, I can say that I very much enjoyed this show, starting with the story that They kept it with a few minor changes, in addition to the wonderful acting of the characters. I loved the character of Aang and how he balanced being a child who wanted to play but carrying responsibility for the world at the same time. I also liked the character of Zuko, his story, his motivations, and his constant struggle to find the Avatar to restore his inheritance to rule. I also liked the change that occurred at Saka\\'s character from what it was in the original series, from a funny character to a domineering character with a painful past and a feeling of letting his father down. The series gave each character its due and gave them enough depth that made us relate to them, in addition to the smooth progression in the story without there being an exaggerated prolongation of events with development with very distinctive and noticeable for the characters, and I also respected the preservation of the atmosphere of mystery and wisdom characteristic of the original series with perfect photography and very excellent CGI. Perhaps there are a few things that I did not like, such as Aang\\'s weak acting in sad moments and the previous Avatars not giving any development to Aang\\'s character. In fact, I think this series is one of the most underrated series in this year because it carries the name and legacy of a great series that created most of young people\\'s childhoods and an audience that looks forward to an iconic work like it, and I expect the second part to be better than the first. The pacing is a little rushed despite the fact that the length of the show is about as long as the original. The best parts of it were when the live action show did its own thing, and the worst parts were the references to the original. Some of the acting is good, some of it isn\\'t. I think it\\'s a fun fantasy show but as a live action remake of the legendary masterpiece it\\'s alright. However, a lot of my complaints could be improved in the second season if they get greenlight. The weaker acting is mostly the child actors who are inexperienced. With more experience they could improve. Also, too much exposition, but in the second season it would be less necessary for new fans so they would cut it out. The pacing could be improved with more than 8 episodes, I think having at least 10 episodes could help the show. Certainly in Hollywood these 5-10 episode hour long movie like shows are not helping anyone. Not the production team or the audience. It\\'s definitely an improvement from the movie, but for sure flawed. The pilot fell a little flat to me, not gonna lie - but episode 2 was pretty awesome. :) It\\'s kind of like they hadn\\'t fully warmed up for episode 1 or something, because the quality rose significantly after that.\\n\\nAnd look, let\\'s just all accept that there\\'s never going to be a live action adaptation of ATLA that truly satisfies us. We love the original too much, it\\'s just an impossible standard to keep up with.\\n\\nThis adaptation is no exception. It doesn\\'t \\'quite\\' live up to its source material. But there are still things to love about it.\\n\\nThe stunning cgi being one of them. The bending looks super cool. We all remember how it took like four earth benders to lift a single rock in the Shyamalan movie, which was laughable. In this adaptation, they\\'re just as skilled with their elements as in the original. I appreciate that. Overall, it\\'s an aesthetically pleasing series.\\n\\nI do agree with some of the other reviewers in regard to the acting, however. Some of the actors come across as a little inexperienced, especially in the pilot.\\n\\nBut in their defence, I think the script sort of makes it difficult for them. Some of the dialogue falls flat, even when it\\'s supposed to be super impactful and dramatic. Plenty of telling-instead-of-showing. It gets a little weird at times. Especially when some of the scenes lack a background soundtrack, so it\\'s just them having straight-to-the-point conversations to the sound of wind. (This, too, got better after that first episode.)\\n\\nAnd despite the acting perhaps lacking every now and again, I think they managed to stay much truer to the original characters this time around, which I\\'m so happy about. Sokka is so much funnier and wittier than in the movie. I actually RECOGNISE him. :) Same goes for Aang. He\\'s a lot better here than in the movie - brighter, happier, more prone to jokes. It\\'s so great to see, after the super stern Sokka and very serious Aang in Shyamalan\\'s version.\\n\\nI think they cast a really good Zuko, too! One of the best actors in the show, hands down.\\n\\n(The actress playing Katara could do with showing a bit more emotion though. Katara was always very expressive - here, she just sort of \\'barely\\' reacts to what\\'s going on around her, with only a few exceptions.)\\n\\nUnfortunately, episode 1 didn\\'t make a great first impression, but I really urge you to give episode 2 a try. :) Dialogues and interactions were forced into a frame that doesn\\'t fit. Intending results didn\\'t seem to be achieved because of this. There\\'s so much marvels that could have been brought to the screen with all elements being bent by magical abilities yet the series dragged slowly through episodes that deviates unrealistically longer from the main events. Concluding episode was too flat as well. However the performances were sincere. Excellent visuals with perfectly synchronized audio. Great special effects one of the noteworthy qualities of the series. A family friendly series to enjoy with patience. It\\'s far from perfect and the cartoon will always be superior. I appreciate it\\'ll be near impossible to redo the cartoon frame by frame and even though it doesn\\'t follow the cartoon exactly, it\\'s done a damn good job at telling the story and extracting the essence and spirit of the original show. Visuals are stunning and the cast are all so fitting, some of the acting is questionable but for kids that haven\\'t had a whole lot of experience in the industry, they didn\\'t make me cringe, so in my eyes that\\'s decent enough and forgivable. (They\\'re much better than the Harry Potter kids when they first started out.) The fighting scenes are all amazing and makes bending look so powerful and devastating, really enjoyable. Most definitely doesn\\'t deserve the 1 star that some of the reviewers have given it, it\\'s a million times better than that movie that shall not be named and watching it brought a nostalgic tear to my eye. Well done Netflix, keep them coming and I hope the series gets a finish and not axed prematurely like a lot of good shows because I can\\'t wait to meet Toph! The show struggles to tell the original story with any degree of subtlety. It feels closer to being a literal explanation of the plot, rather than an entertaining journey of discovery/character growth. Whether it was a conscious decision to water down the storytelling, or a failure of writing, is up for debate.\\n\\nIn the first half of the series, the acting is wooden and the pace is rushed. It\\'s structured more like a series of short stories, making it difficult to get truly engrossed. The second half definitely picks things up, particularly the last couple of episodes. There are a few sweet moments which capture some of the innocence of the original. The effects are also excellent throughout, especially in the fight scenes.\\n\\nWhilst the story telling is somewhat disappointing, and the dialogue is definitely oversimplified/literal, there\\'s enough here to make it a fun watch. It feels mostly aimed at a new/young audience, so don\\'t expect too much if you\\'re a fan of the original series. I did some digging and went through a list of the staff and credits. A writer for this series released a video on how she entered the screenwriting business. Apparently, she got in there by luck, had been a rom-com and fan fiction enthusiast, and was fixated on female-centric themes, whatever that could mean. In her Q&A she mentions how they pitch ideas in the writing room and try to be yes-men for each other. I can\\'t imagine what else I\\'ll find on the others to see how their hobbies and politics shape the show.\\n\\nThe live adaptation, despite similar runtimes, deviates from the creative direction the original series laid out. They cram in cheap scenes between Monk Gyatso and Aang; chop and mix up the reunion sequence with King Bumi and the Gaang; expunge developed habits like Katara\\'s motherly nagging and Sokka\\'s negative thinking; rewrite Azula, the controlling psychopathic princess, as a victim; politicize an ancient Earth Kingdom legend; reveal Ozai\\'s Angels and Fire Lord Ozai himself a bit early; cut out playful scenes like elephant koi and penguin riding; delete subtleties like Katara\\'s necklace affecting Pakku\\'s arc; swap Aang for Sokka in the Cave of Two Lovers dropping the romance; disclose the significance of the comet, etc.\\n\\nThere is also too much exposition when they could be dramatizing an emotional scene. Which has more impact? Aang is constantly pulled on the opposite ends of destiny and freedom. He plays with his airball buddies, impressing them with tricks, then he\\'s told, at the age of 12, he\\'s the Avatar, and his friends begin to alienate him for it. The council\\'s prediction of a looming threat, demands of high level training, losing his sense of belonging, and increasing obligations upset him, despite Gyatso\\'s futile pampering, and Aang, scared and confused, flees into a storm. A century later, he makes new friends, astonishes them with his water bending, then suffers Katara\\'s unpleasant question on his identity, and as he looks away he hits us with a painful answer, but is happily embraced because of it. Or Aang talks to himself. This is just one example out of many.\\n\\nBy choosing the least creative path, you rob the viewer the chance to think and know, to love and hate, to weep and laugh. A story is always stronger by showing the physical actions and details of your characters. There is no shame in following the superior version; in fact, the adaptation relies on the strength of the original to cut seemingly negligible interactions meant to develop their characters. The animated characters had true undeniable chemistry. We don\\'t witness rapport to that extent in the live-action cast.\\n\\nAaron Ehasz, the head writer, did an excellent job in tidying up Bryan and Michael\\'s original series. By now it should be clear you need people to shut down bad ideas too and Ehasz was that guy. Anyway, there is a lot to nitpick, like the casting choices, ticks like trembling or licking lips and vocal fry, cosplay tier costumes, etc. But I\\'d leave that to less busier minds. People hold the new series to a very high standard that the animated series set. Of course, we cant expect that a live action remake identically resembles the animated. Although there are some awkward moments in the script (that I attribute to keeping the characters and script almost too much like the cartoon), this version captures the same energy as the original and the production quality is phenomenal - the CGI is beautiful work, the set designs are intricate. You can certainly see that a large budget was involved. Watching this brings on a huge wave of nostalgia and the characters feel so familiar already as they quite closely resemble the animated characters we love. The music is also true to source material and I think is an underrated component in making the episodes feel authentic. Im excited that we have two more seasons coming up. I have only finished the first episode, but I can already admit that it\\'s MUCH better than the movie (that doesn\\'t exist).\\n\\nIt\\'s not perect, particularly the acting. Aang\\'s actor handles the action scenes very well, but his emotional moments and dramatic scenese are just bad. He has a good bit of Aang\\'s free spirit attitude though so that\\'s nice.\\n\\nThe actions sequences, choreography, and cgi is very impressive and looks expensive. Glad they did it right. Gyatso was a terrific casting as well as some of the other choices including Iroh and Prince Zuko. Sokka and Katarra are not bad.\\n\\nOverall, it\\'s something I\\'m definitely going to finish. As a big fan of the TV show, I was skeptical, particularly after the original showrunners quit due to creative differences, but this has been above average. It\\'s not amazing or anything, but it\\'s solidly good. Pros:\\n\\nIt looks good. The costumes are pretty well designed with lovely details and a certain authenticity to them. The special effects have their moments of lesser quality, but for the most part they\\'re quite impressive.\\n\\nIt reminded me why I love the cartoon so much.\\n\\nCons:\\n\\nWhere to start?\\n\\nMuch of the acting is, well, questionable. It strikes me as a directorial problem, as even some of the seasoned actors are awkward and stiff. But give poor direction to kids and you get \\'emotional\\' scenes that you just have to wince your way through.\\n\\nThe structure of the narrative has been chopped to pieces and shuffled around like a deck of cards. Parts of the plot from the middle of the original book 1 are dragged to the beginning. Even more egregious are the elements from book 2- and some as far as book 3- that find themselves being crow barred into the already shortened plot, resulting in a very rushed pacing that barely has room to draw breath. This also robs large parts of the unfolding story of their mystery and impact.\\n\\nThe character arcs are vague at best and absent at worst. Unfortunately, that includes Aang. The innocent, carefree, playful, and jovial boy in the iceberg is not here. Nor are the layers of his fear, trepidation, guilt, and grief.\\n\\nWhether by necessity of the speedy pace or simply a lack of care, the writing leaves much to be desired. It leans very heavily on the \"tell\" half of \"show don\\'t tell\", with swathes of dialogue that in the original was used for character moments and humour, now dedicated to exposition dumps.\\n\\nThe cliff notes feel of the series, combined with a certain lack of polish and attention to detail, somewhat suggests that the creators didn\\'t really understand what made the cartoon so great. It\\'s missing those subtleties that added so much to the breadth of the world, and makes re-watching such a treat when you notice the fragments of foreshadowing you missed last time. Rather than letting the story and stakes rise and expand naturally, it ticks off plot points like a checklist before quickly moving on.\\n\\nI\\'m quite disappointed. It\\'s a hollow but nice to look at shell of the cartoon, which I shall be watching again instead of this. The film attempts to bring the old feel of the animated version of Avatar: The Legend of Aang. Where the film explores a very interesting editing style. The downside that I feel is that some characters don\\'t reflect their true power. But I quite enjoyed the performance of each role played. I myself have watched avatars from the animated series, Korra to some of them reading comics and some short animations. I realised that avatar is not a children\\'s film but the essence of life.\\n\\nIt\\'s a film that you need to watch but I would recommend watching the animated film because it\\'s better and more engaging. Not sure why people are giving such bad reviews!! I do understand that - in comparison to the original - there are sone things that could be improved - but it also does things better! And as an absolut me fan of the original- it mostly holds true to it!!! Even some conversations are a one to one!!\\n\\nIt is still a series that aims at a broad audience including kids - however, it is a bit more brutal and consequent than the anime. People actually die or are burned - and for me - that gives the plot more credibility and seriousness.\\n\\nAnd maybe thats what others are missing a bit - the lightness or fun that you had in the anime. Don\\'t get me wrong though, it is still often funny and easy to watch.\\n\\nFor me, it is a definite yes and I love it!\\n\\nGood animations, I like the acting, setting etc.\\n\\nJust watch it please, so there will be more episodes and I can have the full series as a live adaptation 😎😊 After waiting for so many years for this, I enjoyed every minute but...story is developing to fast. In animation there are stories that get us closer to characters which here is lacking especially with the character of Sokka. His comments and statements give him that special charm and unfortunately in the series that is not present.\\n\\nI have to say, visual effects are surprisingly good since I presume they made the series for children and not for us, adult fans. Azula is missing that maniacal expressionin her eyes but I realise that it is impossible to present the character in the same way like in animation.\\n\\nDefinitely hoping that we won\\'t have to wait 2 years for next season. It\\'s been a few weeks since this show came out and I\\'ve finally finished it. Since pretty much day one after this came out, I have seen so many videos pop up in my youtube feed criticizing the show, saying how dumb it is, ranking all the worst parts, etc. It kind of blew my mind how it seemed like everybody was just immediately ready to tear it to shreds, so I went into it with some trepidation, but still cautiously excited. Now that I\\'ve finished, I think most of the people who are extremely critical really had unrealistic expectations. And maybe I would have felt the same if I hadn\\'t tempered my own expectations before watching it, since I recently rewatched the original, so it\\'s fresh in my mind. Now that I\\'ve finished this new take on it, overall I really enjoyed it a lot! I\\'m very excited for the next two seasons.\\n\\nThis show isn\\'t perfect, the biggest issue is that Katara is not nearly as fierce as in the original. A lot of people have already mentioned her somewhat emotionless portrayal here, and that\\'s hard to deny. I did see a video of Kiawentiio\\'s original audition tape for the part, and I completely see why they cast her. I\\'m not sure what happened between then and filming, but I doubt it\\'s entirely her fault and I have hope that they can remedy this in later seasons.\\n\\nOther than that, I felt like all the other cast members really fit their characters impressively well. I thought Aang was great, he was able to be serious when that was called for but was still a fun-loving kid like in the original. Ozai was crazy intimidating, Zhao was delightfully slimy, Uncle Iroh was such a sweetheart. I was kind of amazed how perfect Sokka\\'s casting was, he even sounds like the original actor. I hope they add some more humorous moments for him in the future, or at least make his comical moments more funny. I understand that this medium has less comedy potential and I wasn\\'t expecting it to nearly measure up to the original, but given how absolutely brilliant the writing for the original Sokka was, I hope they can step it up at least a bit for him in later seasons. I was still pretty satisfied with how he was in this version given the overall different tone, but Sokka was my favorite character in the original and he wasn\\'t even a contender for my favorite here. But that\\'s mostly because of my absolute favorite part of this adaptation... I\\'m lowkey obsessed with this version of Prince Zuko. Every scene with him in it is a highlight. The best episodes were the ones with more of him and his backstory. His action scenes are extremely cool, his acting is very nuanced and full of emotion, his backstory is fleshed out even more than the original, his relationship with Uncle Iroh made me feel so much emotion and brought me to tears more than once. I will admit, when I first saw the trailer I was thinking, \"this guy doesn\\'t look like the original Zuko, I\\'m disappointed.\" But after actually seeing him in action, I take back that thought. He\\'s absolutely the best thing in the show and it\\'s not even close. I love that in this version, you get to see more clearly early on in the show that Zuko really is a good guy with such a good heart, and literally everything bad about him came from his evil, abusive father. He was already one of the best written characters I\\'ve ever seen, with the absolute best redemption arc I\\'ve ever seen, and they did him justice here.\\n\\nSo, bottom line is, you should give this show a fair chance and enjoy it without comparing it too harshly with the original.\\n\\nAlso Dallas Liu\\'s performance is worth like 5 of the stars I gave the show haha. The script is so cringed,so packed in a dialogue, so forced,the character looks like they reading a text... i can say that they CAN ACT since i saw them in another movies and tv show, its just the the script ruin their act so they looks so bad...they should let the actor improvise the line a little bit... its just really sounds and looks they just read the script directly from the book\\n\\nThe plot also too rushed, i know that maybe they want to packed many episodes in animation to be in 1 netflix episode but i feel its too packed and to fast...but at least its still okay tho...i have no problem with the plot\\n\\nOther than that the costume, the cgi is on point and good\\n\\nIf they will do 2nd season they will fix the script and let the actor improvise without changing the story, i know the writer is the original writer of the animated tv show, but still... i feel like they rush it and want to tell the an episode in anime into one scene in live action, and once again... the script... IT HAVE REALLLY REALLY CRINGE DIALOGUES AND JOKES.. I am a die hard fan of the original (rewatched it more times than I can count!) so I was a skeptic of this remake. I was nervous it would flop.\\n\\nBUT, coming in with ZERO expectations and watching this as if it\\'s a completely different show allowed me to enjoy it for what it is: A NEW SHOW.\\n\\nIt\\'s inspired by the original but not the exact same thing. Just enough similarities for us to know and recognize the world and the characters but taking us on a completely different ride.\\n\\nThe other reviewers who think it needs to be like the original, need to take a backseat. It\\'s impossible to recreate the animation in plot, character development and more.\\n\\nThis show will give the variety we Avatar fans crave: Variety. I\\'m glad it\\'s not a total carbon copy of the original. That way, I can come back to this show for some real life action. And back to the animation for the narrative.\\n\\nWhat it gives us is what we (as kids turn adults) who love the show what we\\'ve always wanted, to watch what bending looks like in real life. First off, thank GOSH this isn\\'t anything CLOSE to the 2010 movie! Lol. Overall, Netflix, I thank you. This is about as close as you can get to live action vs animation. The small pitfalls, so far, are in regard to casting and some choices made to which characters to cast. Most of the Avatar audience, imo, have \"grown up\" by now but they still made a few casting choices that are for, well, the younger audience.\\n\\nI didn\\'t grow up watching the cartoon but I did find it and Korra about 6 years ago and absolutely LOVE the cartoons. So, going into this I was skeptical and hopeful. Imo, they delivered. This version does feel like a live action of the cartoon we all love. The feel of this is great. The CGI is absolutely awesome! Sokka, lmao, that was spot on casting. Same with Aang. Most of the acting and casting is really good. Katara, imo, falls a little short. Her acting is pretty dry tbh. It gets better at times and during others you can really feel her lack of experience.\\n\\nDon\\'t get me wrong guys, this isn\\'t perfect. There are things to be nit picky about. But, comparing this to other failed live-actions, or live actions where they took their own liberties with it, this one feels like Netflix stayed true to the source material and I thank you for that! I can\\'t wait for future seasons!!!\\n\\nKyoshi Island, wow! Lol.. I won\\'t say any more. :) Maybe it\\'s because I just finished the animated series which I truly love rewatching, up there with my Justice League animated collection.\\n\\nWhile the visuals were powerful and impressive, the story telling feels rushed and dialogue feels really forced, esp when trying to fit in the catch phrases from the animated version. I can see why the original creators left the show due to creative differences.\\n\\nThe casting was good though, Zuko is especially spot on and his acting lifts up the show properly\\n\\nThat said, if you haven\\'t watched the animated series, and are new to ATLA, then this show will be exciting to watch. If you finish episode 3 (amazing episode) and are not hooked by that point.....idk what to tell you or what more they could have done. Bizarrely, episode 3 has a lower user score than episode 1 and 2.... i think it\\'s because of some of the changes they made to the story but those changes were brilliant. It was impressive how they took characters and plot points from different episodes and weaved them together. But then people hate on it for not mindlessly sticking to a 1:1 replica of the cartoon.\\n\\nHonestly this show looks awesome, the sets, the colours, it\\'s absolutely magnificent. The action scenes are epic in terms of fight choreography and the cgi for the bending is highly impressive.\\n\\nRegarding the script. Sure there\\'s occasional weak lines- eg Katara telling Jet \"You are the bad guy\" and too many mentions of \"we need to save the world\". But overall the dialogue is pretty good. There\\'s even some beautifully written dialogue in scenes which didn\\'t exist in the original. Or perhaps there\\'s a slightly different interpretation of a certain characters mindset and i was often impressed with the writing.\\n\\nPeople say the humour and charm are gone but they\\'re wrong. They writers have created a fairly serious/dramatic live-action, but there\\'s still a colourful vibe and some funny/wholesome moments dispersed throughout episodes. People complaining that Aang is too mature......eh it\\'s kinda a weak criticism tbh. He is mature but he often has this childlike glowing look of excitement. I like how much energy his actor brings to the role even if occasionally it feels a bit forced.\\n\\nI\\'m often fairly critical of most modern shows tbh, but i actually had pretty high expectations because this is a valuable and beloved series. Episode 1 was a little wobbly for me in terms of storytelling and acting, but once i got into episodes 2 and 3 my high expectations were met and sustained till the end.\\n\\nI\\'m happy that we have this series which takes some creative liberty, while also being faithful to the spirit and message of the original cartoon.\\n\\nIf the writers are reading this, go ahead and be as creative as you want about how to tell the story in season 2. Seriously go for it, because I\\'m a big fan of the cartoon... and the DIFFERENCES are what is making this most interesting for me.\\n\\nThe people obsessed with having a 1:1 replica are a heavy minority of the viewership. If you feel like you can improve the plot in any way, go for it! Be brave!! I\\'ve watched the original animated series multiple times and always enjoy it, so obviously there was some doubt when a live-action series was announced; however, those doubts were cast aside when I started watching the first episode. It\\'s a pretty solid adaptation and I\\'ve been enjoying it (currently on episode 7).\\n\\nThe casting is great with some standing out more than others (love seeing Amber Midthunder!), but a lot of these actors have had little screen time before this, so I\\'m willing to give them time to grow. The writing in general is faithful to the original but the creators also make adjustments to compliment the transition to live-action; honestly, if it was a 100% recreation I don\\'t think it could work. The tone is slightly heavier in this series, so yes some of Aang\\'s childishness is lost, but I\\'m liking it.\\n\\nOverall: great show. I think diehard fans of the original will enjoy watching it, and even those newer to the Avatar world will get hooked. Please keep in mind that this is a live-adaption. It can and should not mirror the animated series which it does not. There have been omissions and changes from the original story but these were not vital to the plot on the whole.\\n\\nThe animation was exceptional, you clearly saw the effort and resources put into that series in many details. Not just the animals and bending but scenery and bigger things looked very good.\\n\\nThe casting, I think, was very well done. Every character reminded me closely of the animated characters and outshines the movie we don\\'t talk about in any way.\\n\\nThe costumes and scenery were very detailed but you could also see where the production reached limits. That\\'s fine, as I said, it should not be a mirror.\\n\\nOne flaw for me was the acting, especially of Ian Ousley who portrays Sokka. I think he was not given enough Charakter depth which is a shame because Sokka is a character that leads through the story when others are less able to. I missed depth in general but in the case of Sokka it really bothered me.\\n\\nOverall, I think this is a great adaption and I\\'m looking forward to the next series. It\\'s got to be a herculean effort to try and recreate the magic of a cartoon world in a live action format, and this really was a good effort with stunning visuals and true to the source physical motions when we see bending scenes. The firebenders in particular bring a shocking brutality to a world which has been at war for a hundred years. Not for kids in that respect.\\n\\nIf one is expecting a cartoon, watch the original which is truly a work of art. The whimsy and joy of it can\\'t be recreated in a story that tries to show us a real world version.\\n\\nI will say that even though so much was well done and involved, a lot felt rushed. This effort tried to take a 20-episode \"book\", and pack it into 8, and while I admit, that there were some areas in which this kind of editing won\\'t show in the long run, it does feel like it\\'s being pushed along too quickly.\\n\\nAs far as the cast goes, there are some brilliant spots, particularly in the adult performances, and the kids don\\'t do too badly for the most part. That said, I think more care could have been taken with casting to better match the characters, not necessarily in looks but in individuality. There\\'s not a whole lot of \"x-factor\" there. Aang and Sokka are bright spots, but the rest of the cast looks like they\\'re interchangeable. Hopefully, they\\'ll improve over time.\\n\\nThere was one other weird, noticeable thing to mention. The costumes are incredibly clever - but way too clean. Possibly some sort of deliberate homage to the cartoon? The hairstyles for Gran Gran and Yue are unbelievably unrealistic and Sokka\\'s necklace makes him look like Pebbles Flintstone, so one wonders if these are cartoon affectations. The sets themselves bring us back to familiar territory, as do occasional bits of dialogue.\\n\\nOverall, this was an enjoyable series. I hope it\\'s continued. As a longtime fan of the original series, I couldn\\'t be happier with how this show turned out. The first episode alone kept me smiling from start to finish. It not only stays true to the original animated series, but also offers some surprises for both longtime fans and newcomers alike. The performances are really good. The tone is just right. The visuals are stunning. The action sequences are emotionally engaging. The cliffhanger definitely leaves you wanting more. Here\\'s hoping this proves to be successful enough to give us a second season. Please don\\'t let the mixed nor negative reviews persuade you from not giving this a chance. Please give this a watch. The series isn\\'t perfect, but it\\'s not bad either. The netflix show does not adapt the original series one-to-one but takes various plots from the original series, puts them together into a new familiar story and tells back stories that are not shown in the original series. However, the main plot of book one is hardly changed. Some changes were very risky. In my opinion they could have used more than 8 episodes. That way they could have improved the story and it wouldn\\'t have felt rushed. The best thing about the series is the cinematography, the effects and of course the bending. The serious tone of the series gives the war a certain weight, which is interesting for the worldbuilding. Some of the characters are also well done, and some characters might evolve in the second season. The series still has potential and could correct a lot of things in the second season. I recently saw the avatar animated series and compare it to the live action one. Although it had some changes I really liked them and want to have more episodes of the new storie arc. I appreciate the series because it remind me of this incredible series. 9.5/10. I recall the first time I saw the avatar when I was 12 years old approximately, it was something magical and mystical, I wanted to become a bender of any element like Zuko, Aang, Katara or Toph and I didn\\'t saw the series ever again until the this series dropped out, I watched the 3 seasons and wanted to defend the live action series because it has its own magic. I love the character of uncle iroh but in the first season it looked kind of angry later in the second and third he was more opened and lovely, in the live action serie it gave him his lovely personality since the begging so I appreciate that. Love that zuko had as its shop members the ones he rescued from His father. That\\'s all give it a try, you will not regret. As with all live-action adaptations, it can never be perfect. There will certainly be haters of this adaptation just like another one of Netflix\\'s productions (One Piece), and though it seems like other reviews would say that \"you will find this show terrible if you cared\", I\\'ve been a long-time fan of the show and I don\\'t think that it was completely terrible. Could they have done better? Absolutely. The kids\\' acting was so-so but these are very young actors and they probably spent a lot of time practicing stunts than acting workshops -- and they can still learn a lot. I was expecting it not to be an exact copy of the animation, which was nice because they did spend some time on things that the animated version didn\\'t. Script writing could definitely be improved but they had some good parts. It is unfortunate to have a highly anticipated reboot falter, especially a second attempt at a reboot. I\\'m fan of the nickelodeon series and understood that a live action reboot may have issues story wise. Converting 20 stories into a single season that\\'s palatable and long enough for the average viewer is necessary. But it\\'s one thing to claim that you\\'ve MADE \"Avatar the Last Airbender\" when it\\'s been stripped of its core.\\n\\nThe biggest issue this series had was character development. Which is a laughable issue to have when you have a clear and concise blueprint already made. They\\'ve replaced the foil of each character from the original series with shallow issues that are resolved with a few minutes of poorly written dialogue.\\n\\nExamples of character development necessary to this story, that was removed or changed, include:\\n\\nHiding behind the excuse that the live action show needed to be different is weak. They promised ATLA and took away what made the show lovable, its characters. This was a messy rendition. The writers failed to create something new with old material, they reduced it. It\\'s commercialized and lazy. You would think with a 20 million dollar budget on each episode, that they would have the means to make it worthwhile.\\n\\nThese are a lot of examples, but it\\'s everything I\\'ve noticed watching. The\\'ve expanded on a couple of themes and moments within the show that made it more interesting. Adding the consequence of Aang merging with the Ocean spirit was cool, and perhaps the most interesting part. I think they should focus on that kind of expansion on themes from the original source material a bit more. I would watch another season, but they need to do better. They need to stick with the original source material. And they would have to let Michael Dante DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko take the reins on writing. First of all: it is \"Appa, yip yip\" to make the Appa fly!!!! Not \"Appa, yip yip\" while being up in the air..... This almost made me turn-off the serie.\\n\\nIf you haven\\'t seen the anime it is a really good serie with beautiful special effects & I would definitely recommend it to you!\\n\\nOn the other hand, if you did watch the anime you will notice huge flaws in some character developments where I will focus my opinion on Sokka, Aang & Katara. The chemistry between these 3 characters isn\\'t the same in the anime. They erased Sokka\\'s personality & replaced it with a ideal version of how it should be in 2024. Which is a big loss on humor & teaching moments such as character growth. Katara & Aang\\'s love at first sight got erased aswel which makes the dynamic between the 3 very different. Wish they made Aang\\'s character more similar to the anime, being a goofball & always looking for fun riding animals goofing around.\\n\\nLast but not least Bumi & Iroh are spot on perfect!!! I know it is hard to bring the series into a live-action format. But everything which is important to this story was cut or left out. They should have stayed with the original creators and let them form a good series. This would have meant a bigger investment, but it would have been paid-out.\\n\\nThey changed parts of the story, casted not so good actors, took the dramaturgy and comedian aspects of the story and saved money for the animation of the elements and animals. Also they added aspects, which did not fit, just for the sake of equality.\\n\\nThe whole season 1 felt like a compromise which could not met the expectations - again.\\n\\nI had no expectations after the movie in 2010 and still I was dissapointet. All in all I did not enjoy the season 1.\\n\\nWould not recommend to anyone. Hey, I get it. You\\'re a true fan of the series, but as a fan you also need to realize that any series made into a live adaptation will never be as good as you dreamed it would be. The amount of character development can\\'t be equal to a book or a cartoon series where the first chapter of 20 episodes is compressed into only 8 episodes. It\\'s not realistic to expect that.\\n\\nWhat I can say, is this comes close to being the best live adaptation of a series I have ever seen and what I believe we will ever get. When do you think, this is ever going to happen again? Would you rather be willing to wait another 18 years before seeing something like this or would you sit back and enjoy it in this moment?\\n\\nThere are some parts of the CGI that does look a bit weird for me, but the fight scenes and the bending are amazing! I expected only a small amount of bending but boy was I wrong. I feel the story is told well enough for the time it is given. Being unfamiliar with the story will give any new avatar watchers the entire explanation they need and make them want to go read the book or watch the cartoon series. The characters play the perfect part, and you see the resemblance in some of them. So much so that I almost fell over in my chair a couple of times seeing them for the first time.\\n\\nMy advice for you is just enjoy it. If you don\\'t like it then go watch the cartoon series, but I know you would rather be watching this! It was a pretty show, some terrible acting, some decent acting. It should have either settled on realistic (serious) or child-like (original). It was a weird middle ground that made you question who the audience was supposed to be. I liked some of the new additions but for the love of everything holy \"show don\\'t tell\". The amount of time they spend talking with unremarkable dialogue and acting drags this show down when it could have been an 8 or 9/10 show. I hope they get a chance to write the second season and have it be less messy and badly written. Make the characters more interesting. Right now it\\'s just too bland and lacks direction compared to the original which managed to do it with 20 minute episodes each containing its own story. Their source material is so strong that it\\'s surprising when they make a sloppy choice as if they didn\\'t know a good way to make the scene make sense. The writers manged to add the a couple off things the orginal atla didnt have. The fire nation raid\\'s on the airbenders and i love that we got more content in episode 1 off gyatso then in a 3 seasons and 61 episode series we got in the whole atla. Soo dont get me wrong there are flaws in this and the other episode but they have made a good story line and i think we can all agree that if the fix the small problems then we have 2 good seasons to cone. The things that i think are very good is espacily the characters off sokka and sukko. I like aang but something is missing and katara gets too anonymous. Sukko is acted perfectly acted and the story about the 41. Divison is so heartwarming and good and this are somethings that the added now which i think the main show missed out on. So if they can get aang to be the goofy kid with extrem strength and make katara more relevant this could be very good. And sokkas character is very good and i like him and his acting alot but i want him too get too say more off his stupid not funny jokes but you laugh eiter whey jokes. So tho conclude it has its flaws but it has alot off posetivs aswell and we all know it can never top the first show but it can still be extremly goooood. The story of Aang in the animated series is so much bigger then the story this serie can tell. They try to put a lot of story in 1 season, with makes it never better then the animated one.\\n\\nFor example, the story behind the tunnels under Omshu (🎶SeCrEt TunNNnNeL 🎶) is different, with is sad.\\n\\nI did enjoy the serie and I hope there will be a season 2 soon. I really want to know how this story ends, how Aang is going to save the world. I also want to know if the (in this serie) very hot Jet will return. I really hope so.\\n\\nI also want to say that Yue in this real life serie is better. She has more layers here. I wanted to like this, but unfortunately it is a hollowed out shell of the story, with no charm or playfullness.\\n\\nEvery line of dialogue feels like it was read of a piece of paper. It\\'s all really bland and uninspired, and so contrived: no one acts like an acting human being, they all feel like npc\\'s in a video game. Sometimes, characters in the background even stop what they are doing while two main characters are having a talk. It\\'s just all so forced and unbelievable :( If you haven\\'t seen the animated original series, please do yourself a favor and watch that one. It is so much more than this. The little emotion i did feel while watching, was because of all the nostalgic resemblances to the original series, not because of any new or transformative work.\\n\\nI was looking forward to hearing the soundtrack, but i\\'m sad to say that it is not much better. The original themes are in there, and they are the highpoint of the score, the rest is just generic orchestral action and suspense stuff.\\n\\nBut the effects were decent. So my first step into TLA world was the horrible, 2010 movie. I didn\\'t watch the animated show until last year, but I will say, this new show does do justice to the animated show. While I wouldn\\'t quite put it on the same level (because it\\'s always difficult to beat the original version of any show), it\\'s not too far off, and it\\'s a thousand times better than the 2010 movie. While this new show isn\\'t exactly 100% in line with the animated show, it is close enough that you don\\'t really notice it. The SFX aren\\'t too over done to the point of being ridiculous, and the writing was done so that it was able to condense a 20 episode animated season, into 8 episodes and not really miss anything (unlike how the movie did..). Can\\'t wait for season 2. I have been a fan of Avatar since I was a kid. I went into this adaptation expectong something that was not going to be a 1:1 adaptation. We\\'ve been told there would be changes for about a year. If you go in expecting the original, you may not like it. If you watch it with an open mind and as it\\'s own canon, you may enjoy it. I definitely did\\n\\nThe visuals and bending are stunning, there are some changes for character interactions and storytelling, but it is not bad as long as you don\\'t expect it to be the exact same as the cartoon\\n\\nEpisode 1 starts a bit meh, but episode 2 is where it really picks up on feel of the OG series.\\n\\nThe characters are not as good as the OG, but that is to be expected.\\n\\nIt is a good, but not amazing series. It is fun to watch. Wish I could give an 8.5, but alas. There\\'s no perfect way to recreate a beloved animated series come to life in a live action format. But this comes close and is so good. Not only is it faithful to what the original series was and tried to convey, but it adds even more lore and detail to the whole storyline. Perfect doesn\\'t mean it\\'s exactly the same. I\\'d be bored if it was the exact same story. It\\'s 80% the same, 20% new, and 100% faithful. I\\'m really confused by the posters that act like this isn\\'t faithful or doesn\\'t do the original show justice.\\n\\nI really enjoyed this and I can\\'t wait for the next two seasons. And I\\'ll rewatch the animated series again in the meantime! If you have seen the original then obviously the Netflix version looks really bad in comparison.\\n\\nIt skips important scenes, the acting is missing passion, and the emotions and comedy we know from the original is not even close.\\n\\nBut, this is not the original, it is a new version compressed to 8 episodes.\\n\\nI believe that those who has never seen Avatar: The last airbender, will love this Netflix version because the effects and cgi is actually really good.\\n\\nI Think we have the technology to make a good real life replica of the Original, but for most of the Original fans its not good enough.\\n\\nAll in all, im disappointed about the result, but i love the effects and the modernization.\\n\\nShould have spent more on acting and redoing certain seances in my opinion. This time around, the real life adaptation of Avatar The Last Airbender hit the right spot, even if it\\'s not at equal par with the original yet.\\n\\nThe 8 episodes of The Book of Water was pretty dang close, but several points kinda missing.\\n\\nSaka became a comedic but understanding character was not 100%. Having to replace his father at young teenager age, Saka has bitter and very sarcastic rude comments here and there in the original series. Here, it\\'s just comedic one liners without offending anyone. The point of showing his rude sarcastic personality was to gradually show growth in him because he will lead the water bender regardless having no bending power.\\n\\nUncle Iroh was played okay by Soon-Hyung Lee, but missing 1 side of personality, the jolly old man side. Lee, being a dramatic actor, has all feature visually and well acted almost all part of Iroh personality, but he just couldn\\'t do the jolly old man side right.\\n\\nDaniel Dae Kim was brilliant, playing the main villain with internal doubt trying to show his son that he cared. In fact Daniel did it better than the original drawing.\\n\\nThe kids were great, especially Aang characterization. The challenge of playing Aang was never the martial art of childish behavior, but Aang was always filled with sadness due to missing 100 years and lost all the people he grew up with. The movie failed to illustrated this sad part.\\n\\nLet\\'s see if Netflix made the second season. I\\'ve been a fan of AtLA for a while and we watch the live-action show with my daughter. The special effects are fire, and the story is told in a different way than the original show, which brings a new way of seeing it. It\\'s different, but if the original show hadn\\'t existed, we would still be all catched up. I love the new dimension brought to the characters and would not change it for nothing. It\\'s a kid show, and still have this essence. Some felt off, like Gran Gran hairs or some effects like Appa flying, but it\\'s still wonderful. I think the cast is wonderfully chosen and I will be watching it again. The animated series, for those who are and are not interested in animated shows, is quite obviously a masterpiece both critically and within pop culture. However, what I love about this series existing is that it opens the world we all love visually while I believe it keeps the spirit, maintains my happiness while watching, and opening up to a live action interested audience possibly persuaded to watch the OG show after this first season piques their interest. I think the OG series will be seen as the true canon still and this series will be seen as the story with less details. Thats the unfortunate part. I love how more people with different tastes can like something that lets people relate with one another no matter their preference in live action or animated. People are threatened that this will replace the animated series but it will bolster it. I\\'m excited to see how they do the next seasons which will surely be coming. I was a huge fan of the animated show as a kid. I even remember when Nickelodeon had first announced that it was a new TV show back in the day. It was one of those once-in-a-lifetime type of cartoons that really sent home a lot of powerful life messages and entertained the young mind in a manner that felt natural - never forced. The caveat to all of this is that there were elements from the show that could only be made possible because of the animation and the incredible performances from the voice actors.\\n\\nNetflix\\'s Avatar: The Last Airbender seeks to rewrite the horrid wrongs made by M. Night Shyamalan\\'s 2010 disastrous adaptation of the source material. I\\'ll start by saying it\\'s not a perfect adaptation - by no means - and the avid fan can see where the source material breaks and sinks with the Netflix film-making formula. The performances from the actors all vary - some incredibly great - some not so good - but not terrible either. The story flows as well as it can - adapted from an animated show to a real life one.\\n\\nI think Gordon Cormier\\'s performance as Aang was good and felt very in-line with how the original character was depicted. There were parts where I think he could\\'ve improved upon, but overall, I think the actor did a decent job for the script he had been given.\\n\\nKiawentiio Tarbell\\'s Katara felt less relatable than with the animated version of the character. I felt like there were some lines that fell flat, emotionless, and otherwise uncaring for the situation at hand. I think the performance improved as the show started to draw to a close, but I wouldn\\'t say it\\'s a terrible performance either.\\n\\nI thought Ian Ousley\\'s performance as Sokka was incredibly good for how I remember the character. I think there were limits to how \"animated\" he could get without it becoming cringe or too cartoonish in a live-action, but for the spirit of who Sokka was in the animated show, Ian did a decent job channeling it here.\\n\\nMy favorite performances ultimately came from Dallas James Liu\\'s Zuko and Paul Sun-Hyung Lee\\'s Uncle Iroh. While nobody can beat the original performances by Dante Basco and Mako/Greg Baldwin respectively, I think those two were a powerhouse duo throughout the show. The character arc that Zuko had felt so impactful and highlighted Zuko\\'s true honorable nature throughout and Iroh\\'s great care for his nephew mirroring his own personal struggle of his own loss was really nice too.\\n\\nAll-in-all, I think it\\'s a pretty good show. I don\\'t think I\\'ll be rewatching it anytime soon - I\\'d rather just rewatch the anime - but it feels like the live adaptation that we should\\'ve gotten over a decade ago. It\\'s not perfect, but I\\'d venture to say that it\\'s good enough and I hope that some of the critique they get from this first season helps them refine a better second season. The hole spirit of the original series is completely gone. They put some key elements of the original one together and cold it an adaption. I\\'m sooo extremely disappointed. Everything essencial is completely lost, like Sokkas humour, which was one of the best parts of the series, kataras strong will is shown in such a ridiculous way, Azula doesn\\'t show her socipathic tendencies, but is shown as a jealous sister. Besides all other side storylines don\\'t go together. It\\'s all just a mix up of the occuring events of the original series. I could just watch it until episode 4 before it was too boring to go on. I really enjoyed the show. It was a bit fast and a bit more edgy than playful like the animated. I personally felt like it should have been more episodes per season like 13 instead of 8. At least there would be a bit more whimsy. It was definitely been than the film by 1 mil. Miles better. But the some of the power of aang was dimmed down. Soka, I felt that his love was really powerful, you saw the strong connection between him and Suki. Katara her power was real, but I didn\\'t see her kindness and how naive she was, now you see more of her cunning and her strength instead of it coming in later. But overall I would definitely watch it again all the way through. An amazing cast, impeccable visuals and great animations! You can tell the actors are really passionate. Sadly they haven\\'t given the time.\\n\\nThe series feels sadly so rushed! As spectator you get hardly no time to laugh, to cry, to be amazed or to breathe between scenes. There\\'s no time for the character arcs.\\n\\nBecause it\\'s so rushed it is like seeing The Amber Island players from the animated series in a real action movie. They had great visuals, as well as a whiny Katara and a hilarious Sokka, Avatarstate YIPYIP!\\n\\nVery watchable but be prepared for a bit of cringe if you\\'re a fan of the animated version. I don\\'t know how people keep doing this. The original show was already successful and somehow this director misses what made the show great and decided to water down the characters and the story. It\\'s incredibly lazy and the only redeemable factor of this show is that it has modern visuals.\\n\\nThe casting for some of the characters could have been a lot better and the dialogue is terrible. It seems like the characters are reading off a script and sometimes the conversations make no sense.\\n\\nThe series feels like it was written by a kid, since the minds of the crew seems more plot-driven than natural. It\\'s no surprise the original creators walked off the project since this new director has no creativity, talent, or faithfulness to the original series. Changing things isn\\'t bad, but if it\\'s to the detriment of the show\\'s plot, characters, or world, then just leave it to someone else. I think people are hating it just because it can\\'t copy the original 1:1 Even though it\\'s different it keeps the idea, characters and everything in place. It has its downsides, I agree. Mainly some cast choices are pretty bad, but the most important characters are well made. The story is as it should be, showing the real problems that Aang and his friend are facing. Story is developing properly, pacing is good, the world is shown and interesting. In summary - this is really well made. CGI is good or very good.\\n\\nDon\\'t listen to the haters and give it a try. It\\'s much better than I expected it to be. I must say that my expectations were not high since it\\'s produced by Netflix and it wasn\\'t necessary with a live action series, I still took it a chance and enjoyed it. Although the bending, many of the casting and editing was great, the show still didn\\'t satisfy me. I absolutely hate how they changed the characters like Katara, Aang and Sokka. They totally misunderstood the characters and the writing totally sucked. The characters seemed dull/to different from the original atla. The acting was also mid, many of the actors did a great job while others just felt awkward.\\n\\nI was happy that they didn\\'t completely copy the og, but changing the characters made no sense what\\'s so ever. The first episode I was extremely dissapointed. The cgi and effects are awesome but the characters are so poorly chosen. The acting just hurt my eyes making it nearly impossible to watch. Initially I rated it 4 stars bcs of that. Especially aAng lacks humour and Pfff just no words. Sokko sucks as well. I really feel for the hardcore fans who waited years on this and understand their dissapointment. Having said that, also a more positive note\\n\\nStill I finished the season and had to admit some chars grow on you still. The storyline is also fine following the show.. it\\'s def not a must see but it\\'s also not a complete waste of time. It wasn\\'t perfect, but it\\'s leagues better than the last live adaptation we got. The animation will always reign supreme, as we all expected, but this was an enjoyable watch. Small inconsistencies in the story and some rushed plot lines aside, this was a fun show. It had that familiar light heartedness yet serious nature that made the animation so timeless, the bending techniques and visual effects were absolutely phenomenal, and I honestly think everyone did a great job with the roles they portrayed. I think the most important thing is it felt like it had heart. Though it wasn\\'t perfect, it was enjoyable and I hope to see the next 2 books adapted in the future. I say this in contrast to the recent netfilx movie \\'R---- M---\\' where the highlight is on the visuals rather than the story. Although this follows an already established story, the writers did a good job showing us a different take. This just shows how deep the original story was. I believe it is the story that will bring this series forward rather than its visuals and acting. Not saying that the visuals here are bad, it\\'s also well done. The action sequences are also good for a series. I heard the actors/actresses did a workshop on tai chi and wu shu before filming. Explains how their movements are not sloppy. The characters, well, they could have used a more appealing Azula. Overall, this series is on the likable side. Just because it\\'s better than the live action movie does not mean it\\'s good.\\n\\nThe acting is the first thing that stands out. Everyone is reading their dialogue like it was the first time they ever read it. And all the dialogue is expositional. I hope this is the exposition episode and in the later episodes they start to have real spoken word. Or this show is in trouble.\\n\\nZuko is the best actor. It\\'s still all expositional but he makes it work or does his best with it.\\n\\nWhere\\'s the humor? Where\\'s the character development?\\n\\nI know we can\\'t capture the show exactly, but give us some light moments, some fun. I know it\\'s the first episode but like come on the movies dialogue is starting to seem better. The detail, characters, animals, surroundings and VFX is insane and makes me feel like a little kid again. Some of the castings were a bit questionable to me but also loved many of the castings quickly. Sokka is my favourite, just as in the animation. The humour is there but subtle. However, the storyline does feel rushed. It\\'s understandable that recreating over 60 episodes of 20 minutes without slacking on the effects is difficult. So I do hope this season opens a window to create a bigger budget for the next season. A few episodes more to add more to the story and seeing Aang more as the main character. Because I am looking forward to season 2! This could have been amazing. The storyline of the animated series has nearly unlimited potential. This live action remake is plagued by unbelievable acting. At times I found myself wondering if I was watching a powerful character in a magical land, or just a valley girl who thinks it\\'s cute to mouth breathe.\\n\\nThe villains lack the villainy that draws the audience into the story line and makes them root for the heroes.\\n\\nOverall the special effects are impressive, but it appears to be a widely delegated project that at times doesn\\'t tie together well. One scene in particular, a flying scene shows the characters moving at a speed far too fast for the overall speed of the film, followed by heavy fog that appears to have been added to cloak the lackluster effects. The scene was rendered fuzzy and notably distracting.\\n\\nIt\\'s worth a watch, but my oh my... The squandered potential is disappointing. This has to be THE WORST acting and THE WORST script and the WORST casting i have seen anywhere in a while. Even the last Airbender film had better effort than this. Am i watching the same thing as the people who have rated it 9 and even 10 here? Modern media is a on a constant downward slope ever since technology made things easy for us. This is eye candy. All their attention went to cgi, costumes, pretty colors and of course *cool* camera zoom ins i e. How after every supposed moment the camera stays at the gawking dumb faces of some character for a few seconds until it focuses on the source of this amazement. Its just sad that people can form a positive opinion about these things. Laziness produced by easy life leads to poor taste in art. Imagine if your girlfriend, or boyfriend, told you that they were going to try to paint the Mona Lisa. You would encourage them to do their best, but ultimately wouldn\\'t expect much. That\\'s how I felt going into this show. The original cartoon is something I grew up with and have watched two times in my adult life. It\\'s a masterpiece.\\n\\nNetflix\\'s live-action remake is like your partner spending months trying to paint the Mona Lisa. They did their homework, tried their best, and spent a ton of time working on it. You are then showed the final result and can\\'t help but respect their effort. Are there faults? Absolutely. But would it be fair to compare my girlfriend to Leonardo da Vinci? No. I mean, she can barely draw a stick figure.\\n\\nBasically, what I\\'m trying to say is that this recreation was never going to hold up to the original. But it does include a decent level of respect regarding the original source material. There were moments watching this where I cringed. But there were just as many where I got chills and thought, \"God damn, they have really done it.\"\\n\\nAll in all, I genuinely hope they carry on with this incredible show, but also learn from their mistakes and improve with each season. Stepping into the world of \"Avatar: The Last Airbender\" (2024-) as a complete newbie is like being dropped into a high-flying airbender race - thrilling, disorienting, and utterly unpredictable. While the captivating story itself soars, some aspects deserve a closer look with a healthy dose of humor.\\n\\nLet\\'s start with the visuals. The show\\'s special effects team deserves a round of applause for conjuring up some breathtaking displays of elemental bending. Fire dances, water twirls, and earth...well, earths. However, at times, the digital landscapes feel a bit like stepping onto a giant green screen, momentarily pulling you out of the immersive experience. It\\'s like watching a behind-the-scenes featurette accidentally spliced into the final cut.\\n\\nThe characters themselves are a curious bunch. While the writing gives them a solid foundation, some of the portrayals, particularly Aang\\'s, haven\\'t quite mastered the art of emotional connection. Let\\'s just say, their tearbending skills could use some work. In some scenes, it felt like watching a group of talented actors rehearsing rather than fully embodying their roles. It\\'s like attending a play where the actors keep forgetting their lines, but the set design is fantastic.\\n\\nDespite these observations, \"Avatar: The Last Airbender\" (2024-) still manages to hold your attention. The story remains engaging, and the visual spectacle, when it hits its mark, is truly impressive. If you\\'re a die-hard fan of the original series, approach this with an open mind and a sense of humor. For newcomers, it\\'s a decent introduction to the world of bending, but don\\'t expect to be completely swept off your feet (unless you\\'re Aang, of course). No. It\\'s not it. But it is now accessible to viewers who will never watch the cartoon original. Should rightly avoid the movie but can become fans of the story in a slightly different media. Good job over all. Acting good, no bad dubbing, great action and believable FX. A great additional way to watch this tale.\\n\\nThe purists will never be happy, those that grew up will never have the same connection but if you have never watched this before and you like super hero movies or even simply action movies then this may be for you. Put it in your netflix list and when you feel like a good time, break out the popcorn and enjoy this for what it is. Very poor acting from most of them. Most importantly no emotion.. it feels like they just had to make something and they did. No engagement. Also, they tried to bring Indian culture here to the series which is poor choice and stop adding the things that doesn\\'t go at all. Why remake something if you can\\'t even make it right! This is not close to anything to the original show. Original show had more engagement humor story.. this is something just they just it for the name to make some money. I hope if they decide to make S2, the acting will be better at least. Their expressions are so poor on the current season. As a life long fan of the series, I was nervous given the past. Having watched all of Netflix\\'s adaptation I am more than happy.\\n\\nThe casting is spot on, the heart and soul of the series is there. Some excellent additions which really give depth to our main characters much earlier in the story and I generally like the decisions made to streamline and combine elements from different animation episodes. The bending is well executed and the VFX are pleasing to watch.\\n\\nWhile this does not reach the heights of the original, after all it is one of the best animations of all time. It is an enjoyable retelling of this most beloved story which respects the past but tries to forge its own path and as with all stories, they adapt and change was they passed down and retold.\\n\\nI cannot wait to return to this world and see how they retell/adapt the story going forward. So fingers crossed Netflix follows through to the end. And I really need to see a live action Toph.\\n\\nBring on season 2. They seem to have captured the base elements of the original show but something is missing. There doesn\\'t seem to be the heart, emotion and comedy (Iroh specifically) that we expected. The relationships between characters are distant and bland, especially between Katara and Sokka. The only relationship I enjoyed was between Iroh and Zuko, it felt emotional enough but it does need the comedy of the original..\\n\\nThere are good elements, the effects and World building is amazing but hopefully they realise where they\\'ve gone wrong if we get a second season (although knowing Netflix it\\'s unlikely).. I\\'m a lifelong ATLA fan - caught a few of these episodes when they dropped in the middle of the night.\\n\\nIt\\'s a shame that the M. Night movie set the bar so low for a live-action ATLA adaptation because anything else is bound to look good in comparison. The objective truth is this is a CW-level production - starting with the script.\\n\\nThe dialogue is so on the nose, very often cringey, and these actors - main, supporting, and extras - just scream cable TV. I know this is a TV adaptation (steaming), but still, the source material deserves better.\\n\\nI hope I can see ATLA adapted to film one day by a real auteur - like what Denis Villeneuve has done with Dune. There are so many good references for ATLA in film, too: wuxia movies (e.g., Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon), Bertolucci\\'s The Last Emperor, even Martin Scorsese\\'s Kundun.\\n\\nMaybe I\\'m just disappointed because that\\'s the live-action ATLA I\\'d like to see - others may enjoy this. I\\'ve only just started watching this series. I\\'m on S01E03 and I really like it. A good balance of drama and action. The Special Effects are done well.\\n\\nI haven\\'t watched the animated show, so don\\'t know if it\\'s following that.\\n\\nIt has a really good plot-line, and keeps the attention of the viewer. It seems to be a fast paced series, so I don\\'t think it will make more than this one season. But you never know, maybe they will try to stretch it out a bit.\\n\\nThe characters are engaging and the performances are well done. The back scene is very engaging. I imagined I was at some of the locations.\\n\\nI\\'ll be watching future episodes and hope they stay up to this review. Normally I don;t even write reviews, but I just came here to say that a lot about this live remake is very well done the effects, world, character visualisation. Except there is a big stinker. The dialogue seems almost inhumane most of the times, it sometimes even feels like they misinterpret the relationships between some of the characters.\\n\\nWhen the connection between characters and acting seems fine I am enjoying the show, however the acting is mostly not that.\\n\\nEspecially the first episode is hard to watch in my oppinion, after that you get used to the way of acting but it still is not something you can get used to completely.\\n\\nI feel like the producers were so close to something amazing (Which can be so hard with these kinds of remakes) yet now so far from it. I have rewatched the cartoon countless times since I was a 5 year old child. Being 22 now and holding this show near and dear to me, I can say the episodes I have watched so far have been GREAT. I don\\'t know how there could possibly be this many bad reviews already! Again, I\\'ve only finished the first couple of episodes but so far it\\'s awesome - the acting is good, casting is GREAT, the special effects are good, there is a good mix of humor and seriousness. Much more grown up than the cartoon too. Give it a frickin chance people. I really cannot understand how there could possibly already be so many bad reviews when the show was literally released today. There were bad reviews before the amount of time it would take to watch the whole thing was up. Jokers. Apparently it\\'s even harder to recreate it. We have characters and stories we have loved for years and it seems that those who created this version do not share that love. Heart, subtlety, innocent mixed with humor, and the art of storytelling can\\'t simply be replaced by graphics and visuals. We as fans wanted more from this production. We\\'ve waited for this recreation and I guess our wait continues. The show is not without its merits and entertainment value but is lacking in the emotion, the intelligence the hidden words and gems of wisdom. The Avatar had been lost for 100 years, let\\'s hope that it does not take another 100 years to truly find him again. This is one of my favorite cartoons. Exciting story line, intriguing character development and so much entertainment.\\n\\nThe live action movie was a total flop because you can not cram 61 episodes of content into a 1 hour 43 min movie.\\n\\nThe tv series adaptation is way better, but not perfect.\\n\\nThe same problem applies. Throughout the cartoon you get so much relationship and character building elements that justifies all the fighting and struggles. Also the audience gets a chance to connect with the characters. So much so that I actually get emotional at moments. That to me shows that this is a great show.\\n\\nEven though they take way more time then a movie and this is 8 episodes for a season, they still have to shorten the story and thereby losing that little bit of magic.\\n\\nThat being said. I thoroughly enjoyed watching this and can\\'t wait to see my favorite characters in the next seasons. If Netflix\\'s doesn\\'t finish the story I\\'ll be so disappointed. They made an awesome start with this, I hope they continue.\\n\\nThey have a great cast, a good special effects department, a steller story and characters to work with. This should be a great succes. Shows like this can show how important it is for movie and tv show to stick to the source material and do not take creative license to much. Netflix Avatar the Last Airbender Live-Action Review (SPOILER FREE) This is all simply my opinion as a fan of the series having grown up watching the show and following the Gaang throughout the years.\\n\\nActing (6/10): not the best and very easy to see that it was the first film/work for many of the cast. The veterans such as Daniel Dae Kim, Paul Sun Hyung Lee, George Takei, and Hiro Kanagawa to name a few, deliver very good performances for their respective roles.\\n\\nStory (3/10): loosely follows the original story from the cartoon, but with a lot of events and characters left out or moved out of chronological order leaving a story that was a shell of what it was supposed to be with a feeling of being rushed unnecessarily.\\n\\nBending (5/10): better than Shyamalan\\'s live action with good choreography but does not stay true to the original martial arts disciplines that the cartoon based each bending off of.\\n\\nCGI/World Building (7/10): good reconstructions and designs of each city and village. Definitely felt like they followed the original Asian culture and world building that was in the cartoon, however there was not a lot of opportunity to get to admire and enjoy the world as the series progressed.\\n\\nWriting (7/10): good dialogue and references to the original show, however, the deliveries fell short and the depth/emotion for the characters was lacking.\\n\\nOverall worthy of a 6/10. If you are looking for an accurate true to the cartoon story, then you will be disappointed (though not as much as the movie). If you approach it with an open mind and are willing to take a new idea on the world of Avatar, then it can be enjoyable and good. Before going into depths I would like to note that I could imagine how hard it was to work on a story, which was made long ago and has its large fan base. I mean I am a fan, and I think re-watched the animated series 10 or 20 times.\\n\\nIn my opinion, the creators managed to let us view the story from new angles without hurting \\'fan feelings\\'. Netflix adaptation looks kinda deeper into the motivation of each character and exposes them more to the audience. I enjoyed the way the authors of the adaption found ways to adapt some events from the original story into the series. It looked seamlessly. Special thanks to the battle scenes with a lot of action and special effects.\\n\\nAs for the actors, some of them did not look sincere or experienced and their acting did not touch me. Curiously enough these were the actors playing the \\'good guys\\'. On the other hand, the actors who portrayed key antagonists from the Fire Nation did their job really well. Especially, Dallas Liu who portrayed Prince Zuko, I would like to really thank him for the work he has done while playing this role. His play was balanced, sincere and professional. I would also like to note the depth of some dialogs or monologs especially involving Uncle Iroh, they were deep with a lot of meaning.\\n\\nAll in all, as a fan, I should say that this is not that failure movie from 2010. It has disadvantages and advantages compared to the original story, but is definitely worth watching. The positive of the show is that I feel like I am immersed into the setting. I feel like i am watching ATLA. This is something a lot of adaptations now a days are getting wrong. They try and rework so much where you loose the feeling of what was originally created.\\n\\nThere are some flaws here and there but honestly, if you are watching the show to find those flaws you will not like this show.\\n\\nIf you just watch it to watch it, you really wont notice them which is a great positive!\\n\\nUnfortuantly, you can not adapt the cartoon style of story telling into a movie as cartoons allow the characters to be more expressive.\\n\\nI think they did their best in over exagerating the main, characterists of the character. With this series it feel very hollow,empty, and not fulfilling at all. Maybe because I haven\\'t finished it but it\\'s so hard to get through. Aang isn\\'t any where as goofy as he was in the original but even in the original he knew when he had to be serious. The remake Aang was overplaying the \"serious acting\" and even if he was going add the goofy trait it\\'ll seem forced, as the all around acting seems anyway.\\n\\nThe CGI isn\\'t all the way horrible but in a lot of scenes it\\'s unbearable to notice it being used.\\n\\n(Same with the green screen affect)\\n\\nI had high hopes for this remake but I guess some things are better off ANIMATED.\\n\\n(this is my first review btw) The casting is fantastic. 100% on point! The acting by everyone was amazing too. I saw a YT video with the actors for Zuko & Katara doing a play by play review of a fight scene with some behind the scenes. I was ABSOLUTELY impressed with their acting there. That video is the reason I started watching it. I have been rewatching and rewinding ever since. Too bad season 1 has so few episodes. That\\'s the only thing disappointing. I absolutely loved the interaction and dynamics between uncle Iroh and Zuko as well. The only other negative is they seemed to have cheaped out on makeup and FX for a couple of scenes, but overall not a big deal. I REALLY REALLY HOPE they do more than 3 seasons. I have just finished watching the first season of Avatar: the last airbender. Full disclosure, I have watched the animation series before, but I don\\'t remember it all that well. And also last Monday I finished watching the terrible season 4 true detective finale (It\\'s so nice to see a series with an actual story and character development!). Anything I watched after that disaster would\\'ve probably been better. And yes this is a lot better!\\n\\nI quite liked this season of Avatar. It is certainly a show made for kids. I think my nephews would like this a lot more than I did. Nevertheless, I found it to be an enjoyable adventure story. If you\\'re constantly making notes to all the differences between this and the original whilst watching than I\\'ll do you a solid: do not watch this! This is not a like for like remake of the animation series. My enjoyment comes from me not remembering the original story and seeing this as its own thing. A lot of the actors in this are very young. As with all young actors it\\'s really a hit or miss depending on the scene. Sometimes they nail it sometimes they don\\'t. I do think that a younger audience (that this is clearly aiming for!) are more forgiving of the acting performances than I am.\\n\\nAll right so I do have one minor issue. Out of our four main characters (Aang, Katara, Sokka and Zuko) I think Aang drew the short end of the stick. I feel like Katara, Sokka and even Zuko have had more character development than Aang did. I like the stories of Katara and Zuko the best. I don\\'t remember much of the animation series but I do remember that Aang was constantly learning and not just learning the bending of the elements. His story arc has largely stayed the same this season. I think it\\'s great that the side characters are getting good character arcs. But I do hope that Aang\\'s story Arc will be central in next season! I went in with an open mind and low expectations... it was pretty disappointing.\\n\\nThe bending is better than the movie, but the dialogue and acting style lacks any emotion. Like...any emotion... from any character. It\\'s almost as if they were trying to be more serious, and it just comes off as bored and dull. It\\'s to the point it\\'s cringy and I can\\'t even look.\\n\\nI was waiting for at least someone to shine but I can definitely tell why the original creators left the show now. Aang is so different and the same with Sokka and Zuko too. None of the humor is there from Aang or Sokka and Zuko has 0 anger in his voice. After watching the whole season I can safely say this adaptation was excellent!!! I can see fans of the series being disappointed in some alternate plot details but I believe it\\'s time to see the bigger picture. It\\'s time for the avatar legend to continue and the live action can do that. It can create and tell new stories even after the end of the original, and even though some plots were slightly changed, I dare say it was for the better. I\\'ve watched both the original and the live action and as a fan of the original I can say that some plot details were depicted clearer and even more descriptively than the original. However it\\'s time to let comparisons go, it\\'s time to see the avatar world rise once more because if it does not, we might not be ever able to witness the continuation of this story. I seriously don\\'t understand how people can give it higher than a 6/10. I\\'m only 4 episodes deep myself, but I\\'ve already seen such ridiculous storyline changes that I almost don\\'t feel like watching it through.\\n\\nIn addition to completely changing the chronological order of very important moments, they are constantly making things up. Copying the characters is very difficult because in the cartoon there are a lot of extreme cartoon-like facial expressions used, but that\\'s exactly why it\\'s so important to recreate the storyline 1 to 1.\\n\\nIn short, the series is really made for people who have not seen the cartoon. The visual effects are impressive and the bending of the elements are really good. Unfortunately, this does not outweigh the flaws in the story. Once again, a flop.... As a fan of the original I decided to give this a fair shot. Watch it with fresh eyes so to speak. So going from there I will start with the bad - the pacing is a bit weird (very fast) and consequently skips over character development moments, especially \"in action\". They talk a lot about what they\\'re thinking and it doesn\\'t come off natural. Simply - the dialogue could be a lot better. And the casting doesn\\'t help. I like a few actors (disregarding how close they actually come to the original char), specifically Sokka, Ozai (probably the best) and a few \"supporting\" chars that are not present that often. The rest I can only describe as beginner actors. Especially Katara and uncle Iroh. Aang.. is also not the best but not as bad.\\n\\nNow the neutral - I\\'m not mad how they restructured the plot, that\\'s fine as it is an adaptation. Very little humor involved, but it is there sometimes. Mentioning Azula here would be fitting - she\\'s alright. But really Zuko and Azula look like little children to me which seems wrong. One more thing I cannot clear from my biased mind is Mai... She was such a badass skinny goth and they cast her as a slightly chubby yes girl. But I put those things in neutral because it\\'s just my bias to the original. I could list a lot here but it\\'s not productive. The original chars are just not what you can expect here at all.\\n\\nThe good - the visuals. God they crafted a wonderful world. The environment, the CGI, fights - it is just amazing. I am truly amazed at this part and I honestly thought this would be the bad part, but it was actually flipped. I imagined the acting and dialogue would be HEAPS better and the world toned down but nooope. Everything went into the visuals. For anyone complains about the rush story, you have to consider the fact that these cast AGE! Esp kids, they\\'ll grow up really fast and don\\'t have enough time to follow the original episode by episode, so I understand why they have to cut off parts.\\n\\nThe acting is decent to me, natural, not over-acting or something, tho I admit there are some quite cringey scenes (especially romantic ones). Aang is perfectly casted, his smile is vibrant, truly Aang\\'s nature. CGI\\'s good enough. And I agree the story could have written better. But I can see the potential and this series is really worth trying! I\\'m an Avatar fan myself and I\\'m so looking forward to the next season. I\\'m halfway through the first season, and I\\'ve noticed a concerning pace in the storyline. Despite having roughly 400 minutes of runtime across eight episodes, the adaptation feels hurried, missing the depth of its animated predecessor, which had about 460 minutes spread over 20 episodes. Key character-building moments from the original have been omitted, replaced by new plots that, in my opinion, feel unnecessary or prematurely introduce elements from later in the series.\\n\\nSo far, Zuko is the only character showing any real development. Despite the introduction of new storylines, the depth of character growth remains lacking. The performances, aside from those of Zuko and Iroh, are disappointing. The cast seems disconnected, as if their participation was reluctant.\\n\\nIt\\'s unclear whether the subpar acting stems from a lack of talent, experience, or poor writing. The dialogue comes across as monotonous and awkward, missing the original\\'s playful humor. The decision to alter Sokka\\'s character to fit modern sensibilities was misguided in my view. A few offbeat jokes in a fantasy series aren\\'t reflective of the creators\\' views on social issues - changing this was unnecessary and led to diluted character interactions filled with bland, generic dialogue. I believe even an AI like ChatGPT could have crafted more authentic scripts, especially by preserving key conversations from the original.\\n\\nOn a positive note, the visual effects surpassed my expectations. The team managed to convincingly recreate the bending techniques within a reasonable budget, a commendable feat for a live-action adaptation.\\n\\nDespite my criticisms, I\\'ve rated the series a 7 out of 10. I believe it could captivate new viewers or those who haven\\'t seen the original series in years. The world of Avatar remains enthralling, with its rich lore likely to engage fans old and new. For me, however, having recently revisited the original series (few weeks ago), this adaptation falls short of recapturing the magic that made the original so memorable. I hope that the rest of the season proves me wrong. The script and the acting is literally so bad you might wanna puke. Like you can tell theyre trying to act, especially that Katara girl.\\n\\nThe script is horrible and cringe. No character development, theres no humour whatsoever and story is a bit rushed.\\n\\nIs it better than the movie ? Maybe.\\n\\nIs it a good series to watch ? I dont think so\\n\\nI think the director miscast a lot of roles here. The only decent actor here is that Zuko guy\\n\\nWell, i think netflix should stop making a careless anime adaptation like this because for ATLA fans its literally their childhood.\\n\\nIt was painful to watch It really was. Overall, I\\'d say the changes were justified in order to produce a fast-paced plot that would give twitchy Netflix subscribers no excuse to click away due to boredom. Maybe the writers were a bit too paranoid about it, but it did hit #1 in almost every country Netflix serves, so they got what they wanted, and no doubt there will be a season two, where hopefully they can slow down, let the story breathe, let the kids goof around, and generally stop being so panic-stricken.\\n\\nBefore then, the kids playing Aang, Katara and Azula need some acting lessons, and the writers need to sharpen up the writing for Azula so she is more convincing as a strategic genius who Daddy thinks could be a worthy successor, and who could lead a conquering army. So far, she comes off as a little brat. But they can turn that around in season 2.\\n\\nFavorite characters: Sokka, Zuko and of course the Cabbage Merchant. Looking forward to the next season. This adaptation has no resemblance with the original in any shape or form if you look at it from the story. It is so simplified and lacks any depth that it doesnt convey the multifaceted messages the original conveyed perfectly. It begs the question as to why would any sane person do this? They somehow thought the idea of taking 4-5 Episodes from the original from different seasons and different locations and put it in blender and just mix it into a mush that has no quality left at all. Also the acting is really bad because they cant act the way the characters are and have totally different personalities. The only good are the animals and locations like Omashu. As a fan i am deeply dissapointed and can completely understand why the Original Writers dont want anything to do with this. Clearly Netflix doesnt care. I just cant wrap my head around how this is popular. After watching this insult i had to watch the original to not explode from pure shock. I like the live action. I believe every media has its own way of telling a story. Don\\'t expect an animated project or a live action or a comic art or literature to tell a story the same way. Keep an open mind.\\n\\nThe best thing this live action did was showing us the details that we didn\\'t see in the animated series like the Airbenders genocide, Azula\\'s arc becoming a perfectionist, the roots behind Sokka\\'s issues with his dad and why he really wants to prove to him that he\\'s a great warrior, and what happened to the solders who Fire Lord Ozai wanted to sacrifice and Zuko stood up for and had a dule with with his Father. The lives action tried to not repeate the original material but it stayed faithful to it by showing parts of the picture that we couldn\\'t see and told the story in a way that\\'s straight to the point and suitable for a live action.\\n\\nI like how the show handled the issue of the Northen water tribe regarding women not being allowed to fight. It ended by all women in the tribe standing up against Paku talking sense to him and the new generation of male water benders admiring katara\\'s fighting.\\n\\nNot her fighting him then he finds out that she is his ex\\'s granddaughter then she gets a pass! I wanted to know how later the women in the northen tribe became allowed to fight because we saw in the legend of Korra her cousin Eska was allowed to fight. I just assumed that there\\'s a time after the war Katara changed the mind of the rest of the tribe because it seemed that only Katara got a pass.\\n\\nThe point is things can be told differently and this depends of on the medium and budget and all those factors affect how a story should be told. You can\\'t have fillers and extra side stories in a live action specially if it\\'s ment to be short. This one is an adaptation. They tried to take the best elements of each episode and combined them into one story arc.\\n\\nIf you want something exactly similar to the source material, just go and rematch the animated series period. The series failed to capture the internal struggle of Aang as to why he ran away. The series choses to cut the important moments which are monumental in deciding what Aang\\'s willingness to take that important step.\\n\\nMost of the dialogs are forced without any real emotion to back them up. They totally aren\\'t able to recreate the original series funny moments which were a key to their bonding.\\n\\nMoreover, Iroh is one of the strong characters but here fails to make any impression. First time watchers will soon forget him. Deviating too far from the original script is a decision which is back firing this season1. I am a huge fan of the original animated series. I\\'ve seen it about 15-20 times. I always learn something new every time I watch it.\\n\\nThis live action was brilliant in its own way. It stuck close to the original but also had creative freedom to dive deeper into the characters which I really appreciated and change the story slightly to make it flow better for an older audience. There were a bunch of things different from the animated vision that took me a second to get over and once I did I really enjoyed it and it kept me on my toes.\\n\\nI can completely understand why every episode wasn\\'t verbatim because A) that would be boring as heck B) it\\'ll be way too costly and C) it wouldn\\'t work in live action. With that being said, I did miss the comedic parts from Sokka or how much of a child Aang is like when he wanted to ride the penguin seals and the Unagi. I also missed Uncle Iroh carefree tea-drinking attitude towards life. I also had to remember that the animated series was made for children and not adults. Whereas I believe this live action was more created for the people that grew up watching the original and wanted something more sophisticated. As for the love at first sight with Aang to Katara, it worked in the animated series but in alive action in 2024 a child liking an older girl and them falling in love would be weird. I think the writers felt the same.\\n\\nZuko is one of my favourites and I liked how they dove more deeply into his character and his past. It gave him even more depth to what I already know about him. It was awesome to watch him become angry due to home circumstances. It was also wonderful to see how and why Uncle Iroh joined him looking for the Avatar. Adding the story about the 41st was an amazing addition. It wasn\\'t just Zuko and Uncle Iroh that they added some tasty tidbits into their back story they actually did that with a lot of the characters. It added to the story, an unexpected bonus. I was also pleased that all the big parts that need to be there were there more or less.\\n\\nI also found the special effects really good while keeping that animated-ish essence. The world building was epic and the bending was top notch. Did you see the ostrich horses? So cool.\\n\\nWhat I found awesome was it was filmed in Vancouver Canada. Some of the actors like Gordon Cormier (Aang) Kiawentiio (Katara) and Paul Sun-Hyung Lee (Uncle Iroh) all great Canadian actors among other Canadians that had rolls along the way. Also, shout out to Tamlyn Tomita (Yukari). She was in The Karate Kid Part II (1986) as Kumiko. Great to see her.\\n\\nI believe the folks that didn\\'t like this wanted it to be verbatim of the original or remember the other live action movie from 2010 as being crap, and it was. They already had an idea of what they wanted from it. Their expectations were doomed to let them down so, they hated it and gave it a poor rating and review. I\\'m not sure why any one would want to watch a remake carbon copy. How boring would that be? Go watch the original if that\\'s what you\\'re looking for.\\n\\nIs it different? In some parts, yes!\\n\\nWas it entertaining? Heck yes!\\n\\nDid it have the same essence of the OG? It sure did.\\n\\nI highly recommend watching this with an open mind and invite the differences as part of the Avatar: The Last Airbender world in, not because you want to hate on it but because you love that world. You\\'ll gain some more insight into each character.\\n\\nI\\'m really looking forward to seeing how they adapt and meet new characters like Toph, Combustion Man or Hama. I can\\'t wait to see Ba Sing Se and the Western Air Temple. Just like Pakku said to Katara: Change is good!! I can\\'t wait to see what other things they add to build on each character as well.\\n\\nBring on season 2!! Excellent bending and CGI, some good fight scenes, some good moments from the actors. A few changes for the better. Gyatsu was so good that I cried during the first ep. Unfortunately Iroh, such an important character, didn\\'t have the same energy as the original. I can\\'t even talk about Bumi\\'s personality. Several character arcs lost their essence, including Aang and Katara. Unnecessary narration, several unnecessary speeches. Some confusing and chaotic episodes. Many lines completely opposite to the character\\'s personality. Calm moments are missing. Dallas Liu (Zuko) carries the series almost single-handedly, I have that to be grateful for. Don\\'t listen to the ever present nay sayers. This adaptation was incredibly watchable. I made it through the first season (thrice!) fully invested and entertained. This rendition brings Avatar into adult-hood. While it did a good job of maintaining some of the silliness that ricocheted Avatar into fandom, it incorporated more mature and violent action scenes and adult concepts that I appreciated. Some of the acting was sub-par, but nothing that I couldn\\'t move past. Overall, it was a success to me! . And I\\'m really happy that Netflix renew it for 2 seasons, I hope they do better job in VFX and terms of more episodes, cause the real events begin now! As far as I can remember, Katara needed a teacher and the people of a city or a country knew thier. Princess. To be honest, the third episode destroyed everything I wanted to see in the series, the characters officially changed,but the fights specialy in Kiyoshi Sequence are great and the acting I\\'m not an actor but i can get it when a actor is not good Aang and Katara could be much more real in acting performance,There were several sequences that were not in the anime and were in the series, which were strangely perfect for me, you know it\\'s good but not someone who\\'s been watching the anime for entire of his life. The plot of the animation is great, but the relationships and character development made it a masterpiece. Not enough time is devoted to characters relationships or development in the live action. The plot is also worse but that is excusable given the difficulty of adapting a show like this.\\n\\nAn attempt was made to make the show much more serious and dark in tone, they succeeded at the cost of most of the reasons I liked the animation. The serious tone means that it is much more difficult to include the goofy comedy the animation has. Sokka has a couple sarcastic jokes, but without Aang as a foil it falls flat for me. Katara is the biggest tragedy however. In the animation she has genuine excitement about bending and seeing the world, she has a bit of a temper (especially when it comes to Sokka), she has an impulsive side (the water bending scroll), she uses sarcasm frequently (making it obvious she grew up with Sokka). All of that is gone, to be honest most of what made her a fun character is gone.\\n\\nThe CGI for the most part is very good, as is the fight choreography, it\\'s cool to see bending done justice in live action. That said, it makes it even more painful to see the characters so lifeless. I gotta hand it to the crew that made this whole production, they did a helluva good job with ATLA, sure a lot of scenes were skipped, key scenarios and characters were combined in certain and very interesting ways, character dynamics changed, but I love the more mature approach to this. Showing that being the avatar is not all fun and games and antics, it\\'s also not about facing dangers alone. The bending in this is a thousand times better than what Shyamalon did, at least these people kept the bending art, even make it a little more realistic with movements. I can\\'t wait to see what more adventures await the series, what Togh will be like, Ba Sing Sa, metal bending, Zuko teaming up with Team Avatar. It was OK better if kept more to source material and not made stupid changes.\\n\\nPreview looked so good at first look except for katara characters looked close to what expected, liked how did bending that was good and looked OK creatures cool but that\\'s about it for good.\\n\\nBad few of many.\\n\\n#. Acting is very poor unfortunate.\\n\\n#. The heart of story and characters that were created seemed to be missing.\\n\\n#. Camera works are just bad especially in action parts and often when bending unfortunate, this lead for me anyway especially in action parts hard to see what happening because shaky, jumpy & too fast moving from place to place so dizzying and unable see what happening. Even weirdly just for walking at times.\\n\\n#. Because parts changed and some left in didn\\'t make sense with changes made just seemed odd.\\n\\n#. Some lines they said kinda made me cringe.\\n\\n#. Missed out too much and changed too much sadly & not for the better.\\n\\nCouldn\\'t help but feel disappointed maybe was expecting too much but at very least would been better if kept to original story no wonder original creature walked away from this. Did they ever watch the Show? 💀 Like seriously is it so hard not to mess up something good? The first episode was actually nice but after that it went downhill especially in the Omashu episodes. The Characters are mostly bland and the fun and jokes are completely missing. It feels like they ripped out the heart of the show and that is just sad.\\n\\nI mean it looks good and the effects are okay, I guess.\\n\\nBut there is so mutch stuff that does not make sense. How are they planning to do season 2 with this??? Keep the characters where they belong, it\\'s not that hard!!!!!!\\n\\nSokka is nice though. And I liked the stuff with Irohs son, the soooooong!!! The acting especially for the actors of Aang and Katara needs a lot of improvement. I\\'m impressed by the performance of Ian and Dallas portraying their respective characters. A lot of you may disagree with me but I\\'m liking Elizabeth Yu\\'s performance as Azula, they were probably setting her character up and how she turns out to be a cold-hearted, manipulative person we all know. I\\'m kinda having a problem on how they portray Bumi here because in the OG series he is funny and sarcastic but intelligent and gives good advices to Aang at the same time and that\\'s what make him a very unique character.\\n\\nThe bending is also surprisingly wonderful. The movements are close to accurate from the OG series. They need a lot of improvement and problems to fix so they can give us a much more better season 2&3. Expectation really do hurt. The Graphics were well put but the storyline and characters didn\\'t suit well. Zuko and his sister acting are worst. Avatar could have shown more strength to his emotions. Sokka acting was too dull. I felt like I was watching a series with less purpose to dive in deep. I usually finish any series if I find it appealing and upto the story but this whole series I watch was rather like coping mechanism for me. Just for the sake. I hope the writers who are planning to write the story and work on the new season should really work hard on the storyline and especially the character which need to deem fit( ownership of character in the series needs to be reconsidered hard). I have seen the anime about 4 or 5 times , alone and with my older kids and then with my younger kid , and I think it one of the best shows ever.\\n\\nI am not trying to compare the live series to the anime , but rather trying to compare the feeling I get when watching each.\\n\\nI think the live adaptation captures a lot of the animes spirit , humour and intent and made me feel at times like I felt when watching the anime.\\n\\nBut there is something uneven in the series , with some parts feeling like they are not coming together , especialy last episode.\\n\\nI hope this will get fixed in the next seasons... While the VFX, bending and environments mostly look good, the usage of greenscreen is blatantly noticable and it feels like I am watching a big cosplay show inspired by the original ATLA. While I get not always being able to film on location, with how obvious the greenscreen is the immersion of the story just falls a bit flat in my opinion.\\n\\nAnd though design-wise the production team really nailed the creatures, wardrobe and environments from source material, through the way of filming and editing, a lot just feels fake. In comparison to an abundance of medium views and close-ups, it becomes noticable there aren\\'t many wide-view shots to even visuals out throughout an episode.\\n\\nThe biggest downer of this adaption hower is how the fun and lovable characters are completely gone or simply not compelling enough. The acting was not solid and watching the main gaang being all business 24/7 leaves no room for forging believable bonds with one another and by the end of the last episode, it just doesn\\'t feel as if the strong-implied-friendship made is real. The only actual chemistry felt in the whole show was between Zuko and Iroh.\\n\\nNext to that, due to maybe a lack of experience and weird scripting it also felt at times as if the main gaang were being outperformed by side characters such as Zhao, Teo and his father (honorable mentioms to them by the way.) This also brings up another point, the awkward dialogue and blatant exposition in this adaptation is truly awful. Being spoonfed the lore of the ATLA world or having characters say their inner thoughts aloud is not the way to go for existing fans nor newcomers and honestly just dumbs down the series a whole lot.\\n\\nAll in all, main plot is rushed, acting could be better, exposition and dialogue is exasperating, choreography, designs and visuals are stunning but cinematography feels off.\\n\\nThis adaptation has the potential to be great, but not with how it stands currently. Probably my expectation is too high. Everything is just so messy here and there. The special effect is not clean, it is not good at all . The music score is boring, sometimes the melody doesnt match the scene and it is kinda distracting. The script is not the best. The sound is not good.\\n\\nHowever my biggest problem is the cast choice and their acting performance. Gordon is okay as Aang, Ian is also okay as Sokka. I think the director miscast Katara and Zuko, I do not feel their character\\'s energy, their face expressions are so bland\\n\\nThe only saving grace of this live action series is the acting performance from the senior actors & actresses. The tv series picked the best and more crucial moments of the anime tv series and brought them into this adaptation.\\n\\nIt\\'s not perfect for sure, there are some narrative issues and mismatches and I think this is why the original writers of the anime series left the Netflix production.\\n\\nThat said, the changes made doesn\\'t impact me at all, a fan who watched the anime series.\\n\\nCould be more fun? Sure, could the narrative and script be closer to the anime series? Absolutely. We know though that it won\\'t be exactly the same, it\\'s never has been with all other adaptations.\\n\\nThe visual effects are fabulous and The Avatar fans should be more thank grateful to having 3 seasons of it on Netflix. Is it worse then the movie? Almost. Should netflix stop making live action adaptations where they don\\'t care about the source? Yes. The acting is terrible and the story is butchered. The character growth isn\\'t there. Aang and his crew do stuff just to do stuff and it\\'s so unbelievable. There\\'s no rhyme or reason to the show. I now fully understand why the original creators of the show left. Netflix just doesn\\'t respect the source and their fans. I\\'m really dissapointed I expected a good show once it was announced, after the creators left I was skeptical, I thought maybe they just left because of new animated shows. After the articles came out I was scared. But I wasn\\'t scared enough. This show is terrible! To sum it up: GOOD: music, VFX, antagonist, character chemistry, world building. BAD: rushed story, earthbenders, some modern language.\\n\\nIn the last 16 years, I\\'ve watched the original animated show about 4 times. I even gave it 10 stars here on IMDB many years ago. I don\\'t call myself a fan, but I do love the original show.\\n\\nAfter the first season of this live-action show, I like what they did with the known elements of the Avatar world (pun intended), since I wasn\\'t expecting an exact copy of the original, nor I wanted one. I believe this new product can be enjoyed separately, considering how complex and expensive a live-action can get, compared to an animated show.\\n\\nVFX was mostly superb, and few times was a bit lacking. Nature elements VFX can be resource-consuming, and although there\\'s room for improvement, it\\'s mostly well integrated to character\\'s movements and other scenes. Landscapes were amazing in most cases. Sound effects and music felt quite accurate for the show.\\n\\nAs for the characters, we will have to wait if audiences who didn\\'t watch the show can keep up with all of them. They are a lot for an 8-episode first season, knowing that most of them should appear in the next seasons. Also, if this show keeps going, might be a good idea to make a movie for the final event.\\n\\nCharacter\\'s chemistry was good, but could be better if it weren\\'t rushed, which affected character development and relationships. It\\'s a bit distracting the use of some modern language expresions, considering the epic and ancient tone the Avatar world has.\\n\\nWhile action scenes and fight choreographies were good (not much shaky camera, fortunately), martial arts movements related to element bending were a bit repetitive, and specially some secondary earthbenders\\' movements, were not solid nor tough (next season should do some justice to that and I\\'m looking forward how the will portray one specific earthbender). That being said, the personality of firebenders and earthbenders was intimidating and ruthless many times, which I appreciate they showed it. And the additional insight about airbenders was beautifully done.\\n\\nI enjoyed this show a lot, and I sincerely hope they continue and finish the story. Go Team Avatar! I feel like they had everything going for them, the set design, production, visual effects, even really good actors !! But the script and plotline fell flat. The actors are all pretty young and new to the limelight, and it was hard to see their potential but watch it go to waste with the awkward and almost forced words. The writers need to learn subtlety - well know its better to show than tell.\\n\\nI also don\\'t understand why they need to make Netflix shows so short. It really is hard to condense the entire world of Avatar into 8 episodes, and I feel like fans will actually appreciate it more if they took the time needed to properly tell the story. Not even at least 10 episodes would\\'ve been ok? You can clearly see the writers struggle with this short timeline as seen by the rewritten plotlines that didn\\'t mesh so well together in the end.\\n\\nStill halfway through and it seems like it\\'s getting better. I\\'m hoping if there\\'s a second season that they make major improvements. The actors who play Aang, Katara, and Azula need to be replaced. None of them capture their characters. I did not believe any of them and their performances fell flat. No emotional intensity, believability, or anything which caused the character\\'s stories to not be properly conveyed. It seemed like the ones who played Aang and Katara were reading off the script and grasping in the wind for the point. Parts where they were supposed to be sad, angry, or excited were subpar. And the one who plays Azula is hardly vicious enough for that role. The character in the cartoon version was ruthless and I didn\\'t get that in her performance. The most I get is spoiled, pissed off brat. And that was not Azula\\'s character. But otherwise, everyone else was great. Awesome special effects but I\\'m kinda disappointed the story really never went anywhere. Aang didn\\'t learn any other disciplines or anything... Yet they skipped to parts of the story where he\\'d already been progressing. I will watch season 2, but they need to get it together. New Aang, Katara, and Azula. The best live action version to date. Although some changes to the storyline are made, none change the general story of the original series. The actor for Aang does a great job. Sokka is spot on. Katara is far better. All in all, a good 1st season. I suspect as the other seasons come out, it will do nothing but improve as the writers and actors settle into the roles and the story progresses. As with any new series, the first season can feel shaky at times. If memory serves me right, the origional animated series was stronger during seasons two and three. All in all, what I have seen so far keeps with the origional story and character building. I recommend watching this one. Honestly, it was better than I thought it would be. In comparison to the 2010 live action take, this adaption at least adheres far closer to the source material while taking the obvious creative liberties.\\n\\nPros\\n\\nDallas Liu\\'s portrayal of Prince Zuko is spot on. A stand out performance for sure. In fact, I like everything the creators of the live action did with Zuko. They hit the mark every time with this guy.\\n\\nJoining Dallas Liu in character portrayal and delivery is Ian Ousley, who delivers a pretty good portrayal of Sakka\\'s dry wit humor. Imo, I feel that Sakka is by far the trickiest character to really nail down in a live action adaption. He\\'s largely comedic relief but then he illustrates spurts of brilliance and seriousness here and there. I feel like Ian did an excellent job navigating the nuances of Sakka\\'s character for the most part.\\n\\nThe Bending is fantastic and the fight choreography is pretty good.\\n\\nThe dynamic between Fire Lord Ozai, Azula, Iroh and Zuko was very well done.\\n\\nCons\\n\\nI found the depth between Team Avatar lacking. The actors who play Aang, Katara and Sakka don\\'t have any on screen chemistry, no emotional depth. They feel more like stage actors reading lines at each other than actors owning their characters respected roles.\\n\\nOddly enough, Aang and Katara don\\'t have any on screen presence compared to their animated counterparts. Katara\\'s personality is like she\\'s an NPC. She doesn\\'t have any real agency and she feels largely like a background character in her own story. Aang is no different. In this adaptation he doesn\\'t FEEL like the main character and again, his character lacks agency.\\n\\nProphetic dreams drive the plot. For some reason Aang\\'s journey is propelled by a random dream sequence of the Fire Nation attacking the Northern Water Tribe... but in the animation, it was a rather very simple reason that triggered Aang, Katara and Sakka to journey up north and that was to find a waterbending master for the BOTH of them to learn from. That\\'s it. That\\'s what started it all. I get for the TV adaption, there is a need to create tension by illustrating certain doom, but this is also a lazy approach. The original animation already laid a simple groundwork that could have easily been lifted into the live action without the need of dream sequences to do most of the legwork. I am an avid fan of the cartoon but even I know translating this into live-action shouldn\\'t be shot-for-shot. Everyone\\'s expections watching live-action are different than animation. This show had so many cringy moments that don\\'t work in live-action. But the visuals were well done and the special effects didn\\'t look cheesy. But, boy, was that dialogue cheesy. I found myself laughing at the poor acting. This is the blame of the director. How do I know that? Because I\\'ve seen some of these actors in other projects and they didn\\'t act that poorly. It ruined the show for me. I\\'m hoping continued shows will improve acting and directing. New \"Avatar: The Last Airbender\" Live Action Review\\n\\nOff the top, I love it. It\\'s not an easy task to truncate 24 episodes into 8 regardless of the triple time 50 min length per episode.\\n\\nCASTING They stayed true to the characters and their personalities. The casting is on point. And ask you, how many opportunities do you see a diverse cast ABCENT of leading white character(s) or a single white \"hero\" that saves a BIPoC cast... in original English language?\\n\\nSCRIPT They largely maintain the course of events well and even with the blending of arcs, they overlap and weave together without feeling crunched. I do however acknowledge they unnecessarily messed with Koh (the face stealer), though; but not enough to compromise the integrity of the production.\\n\\nART & VX The costuming, colour timing, and editing are tight, and unrushed.\\n\\nThe bending... omg the bending. The care they took to create a realistic effect is SO MUCH subtler than what people appreciate. (I used to work in film) they are using a combination of digital and practical effects which results in movement that seemingly obeys physics. There\\'s weight, and resistance to create the effect the bender essentially commands the element move in a manner within those properties. EXCELLENT!\\n\\nLIVE ACTION vs ANIMATION The motion and dialogue have translated well. It\\'s difficult to find the right timing with humour. I think Sokka could have been a little punchier, but his sardonic wit is there, and I hope we see it expand as the character gains confidence with his place on the team.\\n\\nTHEMATIC INCLUSION And now something I didn\\'t expect, but it greatly suits the attenuated maturity of live action and not something that could be highlighted in an age 8+ animated show. THAT IS THE INCLUSION of war trauma and its impact on society, its people and how... generational it is.\\n\\nThe particular moment with Iroh, comes to mind, but there are many to choose from. Regardless of how much we love Iroh, and regardless of his desire to seek redemption and balance-and later his allyship with the Avatar, he was in fact a war criminal. He acted on the behest of an Imperialist conquest. His actions brought of pain and a generation of trauma-even to himself. Looking someone in the eye about that was... well, it was complex. And I appreciated the show not letting him off lightly about it, and also weaving in the consequences of war-its impact, in other places in the show. Shown in this manner, it is UNIQUE to the live action.\\n\\nCONCLUSION All in all, I think this is a great live action adaptation. It feels like there was great effort and consideration in the making of this show. I can appreciate it for its own unique merits without abandoning the intensions of its source work.\\n\\n7.5 - 8/10. I have to confess that I am totally unfamiliar with the anime which is the source of this series and so I cannot comment on how faithful this adaption is to its origin. I recognise that for many watchers, the faithfulness of this adaption to its source is going to make a big impact on how they rate it. I can only comment on how enjoyable this is as a stand alone series. To be honest, I really did enjoy this series. The story is strong enough, the effects and the sets are good enough to keep the viewers attention and even to binge watch. The only down side I can see - and it\\'s a big one - is that the acting throughout is awful. The cast seems to have been chosen based on how oriental they look, not on how well they act. It\\'s hard to find a single cast member whose acting talents are even average. The young lad who plays Aang is one of the worst. Half the time, he speaks so quickly it\\'s impossible to understand what he is saying. Thank goodness for subtitles. I don\\'t know if the original anime was Chinese or Japanese (or otherwise Asian) in origin, but this series is pure Hollywood and America. That\\'s definitely not to its benefit.\\n\\nIn short, I enjoyed this but it is seriously flawed. Sorry I say this, but most of the acting of the diverse characters played by teens is bad, and of the adults, to be true, minimum the half too. Little actors were convincing, main characters so and so, but often the secondary ones were really bad. Not always its the fault of the actors, it can be casting, and it seems mainly to me that directors did not care much about that part. Or writers, seems they did not care much either about giving dialogues depth. If they cared, it did not came through too often.\\n\\nI was constantly thrown out of the story by the acting...\\n\\nCGI good, but what made that possible is the good art design. There often was detail and I would say love in designing the tribes & their logic, spaces, clothes; specially the ships. Also the bending choreographies were coherent. To be honest I never saw the movie only the trailer and a few clips. I knew that it was going to be a really bad movie\\n\\nNow as for this show I really like because it was reborn and also Netflix did the research which made me happy.\\n\\nNow the only problem I have with the show is that the script is very weak and corny. I am enjoying everything else but the scripts and writing is the only thing that I have a problem with. I think they did not think that the viewers would noticed LOL. Which laughable because this is the era of internet opinions and people can be picky half the time. But this time around I am a little picky also.\\n\\nIf Netflix does do a 2nd season with this show then I hope they get better writers. Other wise everything in this show is really good. Although there are many issues with the remake, it is actually very impressive. This remake is darker and has new plot lines. The remake combines many of the original episodes. Some of that is done well some is done horribly. The casting is perfect, set design, music, and pacing is near perfect. The child actors do a fantastic job. This show is meant for individuals who didn\\'t watch the original and original fans who have aged. The only major issue I have with the show is the lack of humor. I miss the potty humor and the goofy scenes that filled the original. Die hard fans of the original will have some reservations but will appreciate many different aspects of this modern masterpiece. This is a show that I think will work better for people who haven\\'t seen the original show, however even from a writing standpoint, the narrative, direction and dialogue lack in a lot of areas.\\n\\nWhat the show does right is the world-building, casting, costume and action. It felt very faithful to the story in that sense. There were even a few moments that were quite touching. I simply wish they took more time in the other areas.\\n\\nThe first half was perhaps the hardest to deal with in those areas as it felt like the writers simply added the exposition from the storyboard directly into the spoken dialogue of the characters rather than let the story and actions - or even inactions - tell the exposition. It felt entirely out of place in what I assume was to info dump to fit it in to the 1-hour blocks of eight-episodes they had while the original series\\' first season had 21 minutes for 20 episodes; there was a lot of dialogue that could\\'ve been cut or edited down.\\n\\nOther issues I had were in regards to direction: Sokka and Suki\\'s story felt wrong in the way Suki was originally presented in her debut episode was not presented here, as was how they portrayed Boomy; more so even for Boomy. I don\\'t know what they were thinking with his character. While the ending was somewhat similar, the journey there felt mean to the character.\\n\\nAll in all, I hope the show gets picked up as the last few episodes they seems to find something of a balance, although maybe it was masked by the overall events of the first season coming to a close. I hope that\\'s not the case. I hope they learn from this season and come back stronger in the second. Avatar The Last Airbender. The most unexpected series I have seen on NETFLIX, my expectations heading into this series was not the best, with the reputation NETFLIX has on making animated series a live remake. This series pushed my expectations and burst it out of the roof. The pacing of the plot could be improved and with some adjustments it would be perfect, but visuals was the one thing that stood out to me, the colours was bursting with the story. Having proper actors and respecting the vision behind AVATAR was also important the casting director was good with their choices. Following the vision of AVATAR and staying with the plot is also important and i felt they respected the initial plot of AVATAR. The Avatar (The Last Airbender) series tells the story of a young boy named Avatar who must master four elemental powers in order to rescue the planet and defeat an enemy. I didn\\'t know about Avatar before, but after watching it, it has quickly become one of my favorite series. I can\\'t wait for the next season, so I\\'m going to watch a cartoon series instead.\\n\\nFirst of all, they did a wonderful job when compared to the previous Airbender film (2010). The show looks fantastic, with good plot, sets, and colors. The young actor who plays Zuko does an outstanding job. The action moments are spectacular in terms of battle choreography. The visuals are fantastic with Bending techniques, the way the elements link with the body of the characters, and the locations are all beautiful. They bring the world to life. However, that is not what Avatar is about. The live series missed significant character development aspects because there were too many plot points and characters to squeeze into fewer episodes. Above all, Aang\\'s story revealed nothing special about him. If I changed perspectives and made Zuko the main character, the entire situation would change. And the story would become more interesting to watch. About the character\\'s role and appearance, I\\'m annoyed by the Sokka character. I don\\'t understand how Sokka was able to kiss two girls in such a short period of time. It doesn\\'t make any sense to me. Moreover, Princess Yue reminds me of my grandmother. She has white hair, which does not suit her age of 16 years old, and she has tied her hair up, which makes her look much older than she is, which bothers me a lot.\\n\\nTo conclude, for those who have not seen the original, I believe this series is worth viewing, but it should do better in the future. I\\'m hoping they have a larger budget from Netflix for season two, which will allow them to stay truer to the script. I certainly feed the nostalgia of the animate series, but if I hadn\\'t seen that, I would not have watched this past the first episode.\\n\\nThe special effects are overall pretty good, although they are quite noticable at times, but it\\'s miles ahead of the Shyamalan movies.\\n\\nThe main issue here is the dialogue and the acting. You can\\'t just carbon copy an anyme to live action, because everything will feel extremely cringe and wooden, which is exactly what happened here. Anime characters tend to feel older than they are, but something feels off when a 12 year old is saying something profound or a 15 year old is in charge of the military.\\n\\nThe acting isn\\'t very good and everything feels like lines being read from a page.\\n\\nThere are worse things out there, but this isn\\'t the amazing remake people were hoping for. Alright, so here\\'s the tea on Netflix\\'s live-action \"Avatar: The Last Airbender\" adaptation. As someone who practically grew up with the original show, I was hyped for this, but it\\'s a bit of a mixed bag.\\n\\nFirst off, let\\'s talk visuals. They nailed it! The bending scenes are straight-up epic, and the CGI is on point. I was legit holding my breath during some of those fight scenes-they were that good.\\n\\nBut then there\\'s the pacing. Like, they tried to cram so much into each episode that it feels kinda rushed, especially in the beginning. You know those moments that hit you right in the feels in the original? Yeah, they kinda lost some of their impact \\'cause they sped through \\'em.\\n\\nAnd don\\'t even get me started on the changes they made. Like, I get that they had to switch things up a bit for the live-action vibe, but some of it just felt unnecessary. Like, why mess with perfection?\\n\\nBut hey, it\\'s not all bad. The casting was pretty spot on. Aang, Katara, Sokka, Zuko-they all brought their A-game. And even though they tweaked some stuff, they still captured the heart and soul of the original series. Like, the friendship vibes and the whole journey of self-discovery? Still there, thank the spirits!\\n\\nOverall, if you\\'re a die-hard \"Avatar\" fan like me, you\\'ll probably still dig it despite its flaws. Just go in with an open mind and remember to appreciate the good stuff. Plus, it\\'s got me pumped for more adventures in the \"Avatar\" universe, so there\\'s that! Just because it\\'s not as bad as the 2010 movie does not mean it\\'s by any means good. There are so many unnecessary plot changes that instead of enhancing the original masterpiece, somehow make the story worse. Azula showing emotions other than arrogance is supposed to be saved for the last season when she truly looses control. The pace is so rushed even though they have practically the same amount of time as the cartoon since each episode is almost an hour long, rather than 20 minutes like the original. The actors are doing all they can with the poor writing they aren\\'t to blame when they aren\\'t given good direction. I completely understand why the original creators left. Roku is funny and making jokes when in the cartoon when he\\'s older he\\'s much calmer than younger him. Also, the wigs, it is 2024, and they have a multi million dollar budget, it\\'s honestly unacceptable. My only hope is that they learn from this season and aren\\'t so prideful and egotistical that they won\\'t take the critiques to heart and improve the next seasons to be released. A serie has more opportunity to give depth to the characters and stay truer to the book(s) or in this case the animated tv show, than a movie. Somehow this serie is not as good as how bad the movie was. They\\'re closer in rating than currently depicted by Imdb. Imho.\\n\\nAnother review here mentions the abominable level of acting. I agree the casting could have been better on some of the characters, but it\\'s too easy to blame the young actors. It\\'s a sum of things. Some of the acting, the obvious fake moustache, the bad cgi parts, the weak dialogues.\\n\\nMy conclusion of the serie is that I\\'d rather rewatch the movie than the serie. Equally pleasurable, less time-consuming. Nothing is ever gonna be spot on. Easier to do things in cartoon than live action. So I see it as a show inspired by the anime and I think it\\'s brilliant! Amazing casting too!\\n\\nSo much better than the movie which was done. The fight scenes are good, makes you really care about everyone. Love the guy who plays uncle, he\\'s out of Star Wars. I cannot wait for book 2 and 3 and know from the anime it only gets bigger and better, so I hope Netflix give them the budget they need to do the big battles to come.\\n\\nEveryone, stop thinking about it and just watch it! You will not regret it, unless you are very very picky \"that cup was more the left in anime, she stepped with her right foot first in the anime not her left\" blah blah blah. Doesn\\'t follow the animated series to a t, there are some differences but they actually work quite well. It is extremely well done. If you were to close your eyes and picture the animated series without the cheesey kids show stuff this is exactly what youd get. Cgi is very well done, they did a great job casting and it\\'s very well written. I really can\\'t describe how much I recommend this show. Easily one of the best adaptations I\\'ve seen. Costume design is great. I have a hard time finding something to criticize. If you like the original show then you\\'ll love this. My only criticism is that it\\'s too short, 10 episodes would have been perfect. Spot on casting for: Suki, Ty Lee, Gran Gran, monk Gyatso, and June (bounty hunter).\\n\\nOkay casting for: Zuko, Sokka (make him funnier), uncle Iroh.\\n\\nI may-have-to-get-some-getting-used-to casting for: Aang, Katara, Momo, Ozai, Princess Yue (better wig needed).\\n\\n-King Bumi is right in between: can I get used to this? Or is it horrible?\\n\\nAbsolute Hor-ri-be casting for: Azula, Mai.\\n\\nWas super excited for this show to come out, HUGE forever fan of The Last Airbender Nickelodeon cartoon. Netflix show has amazing graphics, and choreography, and music (insert heart emoji here).\\n\\nSo.. the episodes were all over the place, but most of season one/Book 1 \"Water\" is in the new Netflix show. About 2-3 cartoon episode stories in one Nflx episode. But they don\\'t go in order and things don\\'t happen the exact same way as they do in the original cartoon episodes. So they took some getting used to, along with the casting.\\n\\nGood job, please do better next season. Recasting a few characters would be a good idea. And FIRE season better be freaking really good, I want to see them all. I will be rewatching this season. I finished the entire season in three days they did an excellent job. The show was well written and the visuals were top notch as well. This is the type of show that Netflix should be proud of. I love the animated series it\\'s my childhood. This show brings that nostalgia and great memories of watching it with my family. I would highly recommend watching this show. I will probably rewatch it again soon. The casting was good as well. You can tell the cast and crew really cared about this project and they wanted to do the animated show justice. All I can say is absolutely loved it and I hope Netflix renews. I love avatar, I use to wake up and run downstairs to watch the OG show. So when this came out I was really excited. But after the first episode I was left disappointed. But continuing on with the show it got a little better. The special Fx are amazing, but the characters lack except for Zuko. Zuko and uncle Iroh carry the show. Instead of watching it for aang, I started watching it for Zuko. So if you dare to watch this show, start watching it for Zuko story and you will love it more. This show has a lot of true potential and I hope to see it grow. The first season is alright. There is a lot of work to be done but I\\'m excited. As someone who thinks the animated series is flawless, I knew this wouldn\\'t live up but still wanted to give it a fiar chance. Visually the show looks great, but the acting and writing are lacking. When I first saw the casting I was excited and had hope for the new series. However, many of the young actors struggled with simple scenes let alone the heavy emotions these characters go through. They overall came across as flat. It didn\\'t help that the script was clumsy. Even the more experienced actors struggled to make the writing compelling. I think if it were my younger self watching it, I\\'d be a fan since the bending was well done. It is not a 1:1 adaptation but that is a good thing because it\\'s very good in its own way. It has been amazing so far. Ian as sokka is incredible! Gordon as aang is surprisingly great. They did such a great job. Once I saw one piece in August I had a gut feeling ATLA would be good. Then I saw the trailer and I KNEW it would be good. Then I heard some questionable things leading up to the release and I got worried but it\\'s safe to say this show is AMAZING! The special effects are on point and it just feels amazing. It\\'s a different feel from the animated version but this is still a high quality feeling I get from this show. <3. I watched the original Avatar and it\\'s one of my favorite shows of all time. Netflix\\'s live action adaptation is obviously not has good as the original, but what they\\'re trying to do is great. They aren\\'t trying to be just like the original and i believe that is why it\\'s getting so much hate. A lot of these bad reviews are just people hating to hate because they have absolutely nothing better to do. If there isn\\'t something to complain about they have to create something to complain about. But one of the biggest complaints I have heard from people is the CGI and I highly disagree. I think it looks great. It will definitely take some time to get used to characters like Azula and Zuko but I think people will eventually get used to them in later seasons. Music is perfect in this, action sequences are great, and the new additions to the story in this are some of the best parts. Where it does fall flat is making our main characters seem like close friends, in the original they seem like great friends right away and the dynamic is great, but in this the dynamic isn\\'t really believable which is one of the best parts of the original. But I think if people stop trying to compare this to the original (Which is very hard to do) and think of it as it\\'s own thing I believe people will really like this and I can\\'t wait to see where this goes. I love the animated last airbender and they made a good choice for the actors especially Aang. The laugh and despair is very well portraited by him.\\n\\nThe special effects are done really well, although the flying Aang without kite is a bit awkward.\\n\\nFurthermore they can not make as many episodes as the cartoon ofcourse but it felt rushed. Not really character development or moments where you could see the friendship of team avatar grow. It all went really fast which gave it not as much depth. For example they did not show a lot of the chemistry in team avatar. Just adventure after adventure, not one episode where they were just travelling and talking and grew to understand each other more deeply.\\n\\nOverall like to watch it though, had low expectations and it was better than expected. :) After finally watching all 8 episodes, I think I can give a valid opinion on the show, having watched the animated series twice and being a huge fan of Avatar.\\n\\nI\\'d like to preface with something I\\'ve heard, that the show looks fake. Especially because of the costumes. I disagree. It feels more lively. Gives me LOTR vibes, colorful and alive. And that\\'s - I think - how fantasy should be.\\n\\nFirst of all, the casting deserves an 8/10. Some characters felt a little off but the protagonists are perfect.\\n\\nSecond, the writing and the way the story is told, deserves a 6.7/10. That\\'s because I feel like they skipped over some of the important -to the fans- parts, but it was still very engaging and interesting to the end. That\\'s what I expected however, since it\\'s just an adaptation.\\n\\nThird, the vfx and the costumes are simply amazing. Something I didn\\'t really expect from an adaptation and a Netflix show. To that I would give a 9/10. The CGI of the animals, Momo and Appa is on point. The costumes are exactly like in the animated series and the bending is how I imagined it would in real life while I was watching as a kid.\\n\\nAll in all, it\\'s certainly a fun little adventure to embark on, will entertain you and if you have similar taste as me you\\'ll want more. Avatar: The Last Airbender\" has solidified its status as a cultural phenomenon, largely due to its meticulous world-building and the dynamic development of its characters. From its visually stunning landscapes to its captivating narrative arcs, the series initially captivates audiences. However, there are moments where rushed explanations betray a hint of lazy writing, undermining the depth of the storytelling.\\n\\nCharacters like Katara and Sokka, while initially engaging, are depicted with an excess of purity, lacking the nuanced flaws and complexities that would make them more relatable and multidimensional. Sokka\\'s early portrayal as somewhat misogynistic and Katara as overly motherly in the cartoon version added depth to their characters, reflecting the societal roles forced upon them. Similarly, Aang\\'s characterization showed progress from someone who initially was unprepared and immature, but who remained good despite trauma. His lack of preparation became his biggest strength.\\n\\nThis journey was extensive, and while the narrator understood it, explaining such complexities detracts from the depth of their journey, reducing it to a formulaic superhero trope that has been overdone in countless narratives. It\\'s a risk that threatens to diminish the uniqueness of the series, likening it to other franchises that have fallen victim to the homogenizing \"Star Wars treatment.\" As much as \"Avatar: The Last Airbender\" excels in many aspects, there\\'s a danger in glossing over intricacies that could elevate it to even greater heights of storytelling excellence. What can I say... The entire cast was perfect, the visual effects were spectacular, the storyline was fantastic, and the experience overall was captivating.\\n\\nThey casted the PERFECT Aang, Katara, and Sokka and gave Aang the perfect edge for what\\'s to come in season 2. I was definitely sceptical when I heard this was going to be released because I\\'m such a fan of the animated version. But I can honestly tell you that I was pleasantly surprised. It was incredible. One thing we have to talk about is the music. Wow what an epic experience they created with the soundtrack. All in all, epic!!!!!!!!! As a die hard fan, there is no escaping comparisons to the original. This is a fairly faithful adaptation in many aspects but deviates from the source material in places where it really matters.\\n\\nTo give credit where it\\'s due, the environment, costumes, makeup and effects are stunning. The world has been brought to life and it is incredibly immersive - but also faithful. It\\'s clear a lot of work went into making things look and feel modern without ruining the aura of the original. Every location is instantly recognizable to fans but it\\'s illustrative theming works wonders for even a first time watcher. No complaints here. The fighting choreography isn\\'t bad when it gets going but there are budget limitations without a doubt which do cause fights to end early and they often throw in more hand to hand combat than necessary to save on animation and digital effects that a long form bending fight would require.\\n\\nOn the other hand, both the actors and acting are a mixed bag. The older and clearly more experienced actors do a great job. Iroh and Ozai for example mimic their animated counterparts extremely well in both likeness and demeanor. I\\'m not expecting a 1:1 copy; obviously these are human beings and not drawn characters so some compromises have to be made, yet many of the characters do land.\\n\\nWith that being said, some really don\\'t. And generally speaking it\\'s the child actors which also happened to be the most important characters. Aang and Katara especially just do not align with how they are represented in the original. Whether it be a lack of experience, lack of direction or the changes to the script, it just doesn\\'t work. Aang is probably the biggest miss which hurts the most.\\n\\nPart of this has to be that there are actors this time, not just voice actors. You can\\'t exactly have a 20 year old playing a 12 year old on screen, but this is completely possible in animated works. There isn\\'t a great way to solve this issue, but it still ruins many lines nonetheless. Zuko doesn\\'t have the anger and pain in his deep voice while Aang lacks the fun loving and determined aura he always has. It is especially bad when multiple young characters are on screen together. I mean Azula, Mai and Ty Lee look and sound nothing like how they are supposed to and I honestly ended up laughing the first time they were on screen together.\\n\\nLastly, the story. It got shaken up quite a bit but the key elements are mostly there. If you are a fan you will be scratching your head in many moments thinking \"that\\'s not how this happened\" and it can be off putting. Stripping out \"filler\" content is inevitable when condensing the show to 8 episodes and you do lose a lot of character building in the moments taken out but it\\'s not the end of the world. They did however make some pretty drastic changes to many of the reasons, beliefs and emotions that play huge roles in the original. This is the most unforgivable sin and it feels like the writers completely misunderstood the creators intentions. There are times when the motivation for an event is just completely at odds with how the original conveyed it and it ends up landing horribly. This is true even for someone who hasn\\'t seen the anime because of how they failed to capture the emotional weight the scene by changing it up.\\n\\nOverall, it\\'s not bad. If you aren\\'t already a fan but like fantasy you will probably enjoy it. The script has its weaknesses and the child actors are a let down at times but the world building and authenticity does immerse you in a good time. If you are a fan, forget about the events matching up and the characters having the same emotional weight behind their decisions. It\\'s no where near as good as the masterpiece which is the original.. but it\\'s a fun watch anyway. The story and effects r really great. The most devastating disaster are the actors. It seems like they have opted for the cheapest cast available in the talent market. Horrible screenplay and editing. The casting and the blooming love stories are just too much to handle. Just a wasted opportunity with such a great story and current technology. The expression less actors make it a horrible watch. Eventually one gives up, as there is no connection happening with the screen life. Its such an iront that the cast director found every actor which is at their worst. Cant stand anymore, E3 is the farthest i could go. As someone who remembers the original animated series and grew up with the franchise in the 90s all I have to say is wow the series Is incredible it\\'s perfectly adapted and a lot better and faithful than the original film in the 2000s I absolutely think that the cast was perfect the premise is really cool and there\\'s a lot of things that give you hope and it\\'s very violent and gory and not afraid to take risks and the best possible way something that I don\\'t remember the original anime or film did at all I absolutely hope this series will go on for many years to come and I highly recommend anyone watch it. I am a fan of the original animated series. I am not a fan of the M Night Shaymalan movie. What makes this live action series great for me is the casting. The main cast character I fell in love with is Uncle Iroh played by Paul Sun-Hyung Lee. I thought that Mako defined this role, but I was wrong. Paul\\'s Uncle Iroh is so endearing, supportive and cares and that caring goes beyond Zuko, he cares about the world. I feel Paul was born to play this role. I also thought that Daniel Dae Kim does an excellent job playing Firelord Ozai. He plays Ozai as a coniving, manipulative, power hungry character, that is a terrible father. I love the complexity of this evil character. The other standout character and actor is Amber Midthunder as Princess Yue. She played this character so close to the animated series, it was uncanny. I also loved the choices for Aang, Katara, and Sokka. They were right on the mark for playing these characters versus the movie. Gordon Cormier, Kiawentiio and Ian Ousley were perfect for the roles. I also loved animated Appa. This character is the best Appa of the three. I loved his tale and his face. Also, the special effects for the Water, Earth, and Fire bending is better than the movie. I do not expect live action to be as good as the animated series, but it comes very close and was satisfying for me in this live action series. What I could not believe happened to me, is that I was sucked into the series and I binge watch it the first time and could not stop watching. I was hooked on the series emotionally and was tearing up, laughing, yelling at the TV screen and all in all thoroughly engrossed in the characters and the story. I read somewhere that someone calls this a love song to Asian actots. Well, I loved all the actors in this series. The scenes that were especially impactful were finding the Avatar, visiting Kyoshi Island, finding the Southern Air Temple, visiting the Fire Temple, visiting with Bumi at Omashu and the climatic battle at the Northern Water Temple. I really hope that Netflix renews this for at two more seasons to play out the story. If not, at least I got to see this excellent live action remake and I like that they made it more for an adult audience. Thank you Netflix for an emotional good time. Same mistake with most live action adaptations , they take the source material, they scrap it and they make something that seems familiar but isn\\'t . I know that some things have to change but not entire storylines . Characters feel like that are missing something, set pieces look good . Moreover , they took pieces and little things out of everything and they tried to blend it all together with out explaining, just for the viewer to kinda feel nostalgic of the original . I am not hating it , but I cannot like this either . Some key moments from the OG feel forced and a bit rushed . Casting is excellent though. Adapting a show like Avatar to live action, reliant on child characters and tons of visual effects, is a tall task (ask M. Night).\\n\\nThis show manages to pull it off as well as anyone could hope for.\\n\\nIt is a bit more serious/less silly, but still manages to capture much of the charm of the cartoon. All of the major themes are still conveyed, and no characters are butchered. The young actors are usually the downfall of shows like this, but the cast does a good job. The visual effects are downright impressive and the bending looks great. There is even a unique storyline addition that was brilliant.\\n\\nCompared to the previous attempt to adapt this show, this is a 20/10. I will definitely tune in to a season 2. The first movie adaptation was horrible. This is significantly better, but still shares many of the same issues as last time. Weird pronunciation of words like avatar. The writing is not compelling. Actors are high school drama quality. Being good at acting is more important than being a black belt. The creators of the TV show left the project. Whoever decided they knew better than the creators should\\'ve been fired on the spot. This is why the quality of TV these days is poor. Great, there\\'s no white people. What an accomplishment. I could write a better script than this if you gave me a week. I was hyped up for this because the original creators were apart of this, so I figured it would at least be worth watching. Until they left over creative differences, so my worries began to grow. I\\'ve read the many average reviews and was even more worried but I figured I\\'d at least give it a try, and boy were the reviews right.\\n\\nThis was just so disappointing and felt wrong from the very beginning. It\\'s as if the original was the perfect meal you\\'ve ever had and then someone comes out and tries to replicate it but serves you the most bland, tasteless meal full of disappointment and despair that just makes you feel like a chump. I stopped watching it after the second episode and had to start the original just to get the awful taste out of my mouth.\\n\\nSpecial effects are ok, the acting effort is ok, the story is the same big picture but unfortunately without any of the character development scenes that let the characters grow into what they need to become. They even changed the crucial details that tied the whole avatar process with the moral of the story which was infuriating.\\n\\nTry it if you want but prepare to be disappointed. So as a massive fan of the animated series, I was extremely sceptical of this adaptation especially considering what we got with the previous live attempt.\\n\\nWhilst there are things to nit pick about, this show comes super close to showing us this Avatar world that we love. The actors did their damn best and the team that CGI\\'d the environment gave it more than their 100%. I was pleasantly glad I got to see this show! Uncle Iroh and Zuko absolutely killed it, just a phenomenal job representing the greatest relationship and character arc that Avatar has to offer.\\n\\nIf you\\'re a returning fan, I recommend watching this with a new lens instead of perhaps comparing every little scene to the animation. We are never going to get anything close to the brilliance of the animation... this show does a good job making the attempt. People always have something to complain about. I don\\'t understand these bad reviews. Yes it\\'s not exactly the same, and yes maybe its not as funny as the original et cetera. But its impossible to make the live action exactly the same as the original, while also keeping the quality. A live action is just way different then a cartoon. Actually, the small changes in the story or the \\'extra\\'s\\', I like them.\\n\\nThe story is almost the same, the acting is very good (reminds me of the characters in the original one), and the visuals are amazing.\\n\\nI recommend less people complain, so we get a season 2 and 3. As someone who casually watched the original cartoon as a kid and binged the whole show a few years ago, I don\\'t have the obsessive attachment to the cartoon that many fans do. Sure, the overall mood is darker, there\\'s a few clunky lines of exposition, events have been moved around and some character arcs have been altered, but this adaptation still tells a great, heartfelt story with some great CGI and well-choreographed fight scenes. Some may say the story seems rushed, I say they removed the filler from the original show and stuck to its most relevant plot points.\\n\\nIt\\'s an adaptation, not a scene-by-scene recreation. Netflix\\'s Avatar does its own thing, but in my opinion still manages to keep the core heart and messages of the original story. The live-action Avatar series is... mediocre; many of its successes are overshadowed by significant flaws where it strips away the essence that defines certain characters, reducing them to something simpler and far from epic or transcendent, unlike its original series. Despite the effort to adapt a series with a lot of love and dedication behind it, this new installment feels like a mere compensation for the disaster that was its first attempt in the infamous 2010 movie. However, even though it\\'s better than that, it falls short in creating its own identity that could serve as a catalyst for a fair and deserved adaptation on par with the original or, at the very least, evoke a fresh and new feeling that truly leaves the viewer wanting more. One thing I have to say about this new live-action is that it gives me hope that they\\'ll deliver something where it\\'s evident they put in more effort. Episode 1 starts off with a bang, a new addition like many, which adds more lore to the already rich story of the avatar universe. The adaptation does a great job of taking elements from the animated series but adds its own stuff.\\n\\nWhile I didn\\'t enjoy some changes, for example, omission of certain characters and changing the arc of certain characters like Bumi, it still does good.\\n\\nThe story has a slight mature tone but that doesn\\'t mean it \\'s not fun, which was the right decision. If the series was a 1:1 shot remake, it wouldn\\'t translate well as a live action.\\n\\nOne or two episode seem rushed but all in all, it\\'s a solid 8/10 adaptation. The portrayals are mostly good. I thoroughly enjoyed Zuko, Zhao & Kyoshi the most. The bending looks great and as a big fan, I can say the showrunners did a good job. CGI is pretty good but.....\\n\\nI think casting wise the actors seem like a good choice. The actual acting is hot garbage. Every. Single. Line. Feels. Forced.. This comes down to horrible script and directing... The actors that portray Aang and Katarra have this really weird head bobbling and weird facial expression thing going on. Iroh\\'s actor sucks. Zuko\\'s actor has some flash in the pan moments. Sokka\\'s character is played fairly well. Lord Ozai is the only thing that\\'s done really well. Azula\\'s actor is the worst performance out of all of them, she\\'s not intimidating AT ALL. No way does Azula have the capacity for lightning psshh. Imagine you never saw the original before this?\\n\\nATLA is somewhat decent adaptation that will likely seem average to many viewers, especially if you have seen the original. However, I believe this reception stems from the immense weight of expectations placed on it. The original animated series remains an undisputed masterpiece, and equaling, let alone topping, such brilliance is an incredibly tough if not an impossible challenge. Though this is a common issue for Netflix adaptations, ATLA also faces the unique pressure of living up to a series many consider nearly perfect as an animated show can be.\\n\\nYet despite these challenges, I found ATLA to be worthwhile viewing overall, especially to new viewers. The adaptation makes certain changes that give it a distinct identity from the source material, add to that a refreshing takes on casting, visuals, and cultural representation being particularly impressive, when compare to the other live-action. In fact, when compared to other live-action, these elements make this adaptation look top tier. While I sincerely hope that the second season build upon the first and smooth out some rough patches, this initial outing delivers an experience that, at its best moments, recaptures a little glimpses of the original\\'s magic - even if it falls short of fully reaching those great heights. This is more to vent than anything. The show started off solid. IF you are hating the show 2 episodes in, I promised you it only gets worse.\\n\\nThe acting by Sokka and Zuko is solid, Aang and Katara look a little lost, and the rest of the characters arent their characters. I do appreciate the direction with zhao, but that said, not sure why they thought some of these cuts work.\\n\\nThe worst part is the story direction and lack of respect of even the most crucial plot points. Even on limited time they start sprinkling in season 2 plotlines and coming multiple episodes without regard. Some changes serve no purpose and only break canon.\\n\\nJust skip this and stick to the animated show, it\\'s exponentially better and this show will likely be cancelled after season 2 because whoever was in charge of season 1 will likely still be around. Important things first: the passion for the world is there, and they knew what they were adapting. While we already knew years ago that this wouldn\\'t be a full 1:1, changes are always a pill to swallow for some fans, even when it comes to smaller changes. I am happy to say that the core of ATLA is there, but that this feels like you are experiencing through a different lens, as if you are looking at the same artwork painted by a different artist.\\n\\nMeanless to say, this project feels like it has a hopeful future and after hearing the director and the cast talk about being very eager on doing the future seasons, let\\'s hope Netflix does continue on until the end. 1. Too much reliance on CGI, I think they would have done this whole series with new text to AI video generator from chatGPT but thank good ness it didnt get released early enough.\\n\\n2. the costume, the fake beard, the wig can be easily made out to be fake 3. Too many cut scenes, Why so many cut scenes?\\n\\n4. template, readymade background music of screaming orchestra singers singing chorus, didng help 5. Classic click bait or trailer bait stuff 6. Cast is okay okay 7. Why is CGI getting worse when the tech is getting better ? It seems like there are artists who are engineers but it is just techies relieng on tools to fake themselves as artists 8. Movie, series making was art but now unfortunately it is being treated too much as a business and shareholders who do not know art but only money, want to pump in a lot of quantity in a short time than producing quality stuff.\\n\\n9. It seems they have taken users for granted. Yes they have tried. But why risk so much on remaking a series with a cult following.\\n\\nNothing matches. Dialogues hold no meaning, screenplay is slow and lame. It was so lame that I watched whole series on fast forward, trying to find something interesting. None of the scenes have the power to bind you. Its just so easily forgettable. Infact I am forcing myself to see the whole series, just to find something which can make sense.\\n\\nWhere is the fun ?\\n\\nWhy did they have to cover so much so fast that they forgot about putting soul to this beautiful story.\\n\\nI think they should stop trying to make a live action series on this story and concentrate on getting something animated which is more funny and relatable.\\n\\nI wish it would have been made in a different way.\\n\\nI am disappointed. Captures the spirit of the original series while also sorting through the filler of the cartoon\\'s first season. If you are a die hard fan there is plenty of 1:1 recreation shots you will love! The fighting choreography really stood out. And I was surprised with how much violence they got away with at a TVPG RATING. With that being said this cast skews a bit young, and the dialogue is a reflection of that. The dynamic between the cast really grows as the episodes go on. I hope it gets renewed for season 2 because this series deserves a finished story. You can\\'t judge this series with a bias so please leave that at the door when watching. This is my first review ever. This show is hot garbage. No wonder the creators ditched netflix. Stop thinking you can reinvent the wheel...what a dissapointment.\\n\\nCg is poor, acting is worse, script...yeh...the only thing they got right is the cinematography. This will go down as mnight 2.0.\\n\\nDo yourself a favor and preserve the original memory of the show by skipping this one. Netflix needs to hire better directors and fast.\\n\\nInsert more dtuff about review blah blah blah...wish i could but there is nothing redeemable...i need 60p characters to leave this review...lets judt ramble non sense like this show... This is not the cartoon, it\\'s streamlined, darker and grittier. That being said they did an excellent job of adapting these characters to real life. The bending is gorgeous and designs are flawless. True that it doesn\\'t have the humor and fluffy warmheartedness of the original but overall a solid adaptation, especially when comparing it to the M Knight blasphemous version. It\\'s a shame if fans of the original don\\'t give this a chance because of all the negative feedback it was getting before the official release. I\\'m glad I gave this a shot, I think if they are given the opportunity to continue the show it will continue to get better. I honestly think a lot of people decided they weren\\'t going to like this show before they even watched it. I can\\'t say I had high hopes myself but I kept an open mind and I\\'m completely floored.\\n\\nThe effects, the settings, the music are all absolutely top notch, but that would mean nothing without a good cast, and this show has an amazing cast. While it\\'s true that some cast members are more experienced than others, this only adds to the feeling of a bunch of wide-eyed kids who haven\\'t yet found their feet in life taking on something far bigger than they are. The feeling of \"people pulling together and doing their best\" is heavily accentuated by the greenness of most of the actors.\\n\\nI was delighted to find that Aang is no longer the ludicrously wacky cartoon character seen in the original. He has a great balance of being lighthearted without being a clown, and serious without being melodramatic.\\n\\nThe guy playing Sokka feels like he was genetically designed for the part and feels much more believable and relatable than the original voice actor, who was way too hammy and derpy.\\n\\nI didn\\'t think anyone could top the original Katara, who carried the show imo, but the new actress is truly something else and undoubtedly has a sparkling career ahead of her.\\n\\nYes, the story is presented with far less depth than the original but the presentation suits the live action format brilliantly. I see this as an exceptionally well crafted companion piece to the original, and I feel sorry for those who fail to see the magic in this show.\\n\\nIf they cancel it due to people who can\\'t loosen up and enjoy something different to what they\\'re used to, I\\'ll consider it a great loss. A highly anticipated series lived up to expectations in its first season. Following the storyline of the original animated series, which resonates positively with me as a devoted fan, I therefore can say it\\'s truly enjoyable to watch.\\n\\nThe landscapes, cities, and characters are vividly portrayed, creating a realistic and captivating world. The action scenes and fight choreography seamlessly integrate into the series, providing an engaging viewing experience as you expect from the animated show. The CGI, visual effects, costumes, and ambiance contribute to a high-quality production, evoking a strong and immersive \"avatar\" vibe.\\n\\nWhile the acting of the main characters may occasionally feel a bit forced, this becomes less noticeable over time. The series comprises eight episodes, each offering compelling stories and well-executed action, avoiding any dull fillers or low resolution gaps between episodes.\\n\\nHowever, my main critique lies in the series\\' inability to deeply connect me with the characters which the animated show does verry well , leaving a somewhat shallow impression. Despite this, there\\'s hope that the character development will evolve in the upcoming season. Overall, it\\'s a great watch, though not reaching the level of being exceptional. It may not follow the 22 minute cartoon episodes that I\\'ve watched 4 or 5 times over the last 20 years. But there\\'s something that human actors just bring to the story. Emotion. There is so much more depth to the story, more backstory you just can\\'t add with a graphical representation that makes this so deep. The bending is well done and the characters are much richer when you can see the emotion in their eyes and posture. A script can only provide so much. The actors provide way more context than I could have hoped for. Forget about the differences and just hope we get to the final battle. I think the originals last four episodes will be worth seeing this one to the end. 7/10 Not bad, not perfect. Entertaining, but as someone who\\'s seen the original it did annoy me how often they diverged from the source material. Just a bunch of mish-mash of episodes and story lines.\\n\\nEffects and scenery were great.\\n\\nThe original has so much humor, which they sadly mostly ignored in this. Laugh a little, eh?\\n\\nSome of the actors need crying lessons, producing tears seemed to be a big issue for many.\\n\\nI hope they take the critique they get from this first season and listen to it before tackling a second one. Hopefully they will follow the original more than they did this time around.\\n\\nAgain, it wasn\\'t bad, not at all, just fell into the \"serious\" trap that sadly the first live action adaptation also did, although this one was not /as/ bad. I\\'ve been watching with someone who never saw the cartoon and it really helped to see it through that view. As a show of its own it\\'s worthy of the rating given (where as if uh watched the cartoon this is more of a 5-6). As a \"remake\" live action version it does not do justice to the show. I do however love that they didn\\'t white wash it. What the constructive criticism of the lower reviews are correct about is that the show lacks character development/depth and this has a rushed pace. Watching the show as a stand alone it makes little to no sense and the scenes are forced into one another making no connection with zero explanation (from the viewers point who didn\\'t watch the cartoon). Since I saw the cartoon I constantly had to fill in the massive gaps, when they wanted to know what was going on.\\n\\nOverall it\\'s just ok and it could be better if they truly wanted a larger fan base and to make this the next biggest show. The fact that it\\'s pretty and all the special effects are well done makes this worthy of a watch. With that said it is a terribly sad attempt at a live action version of a cartoon that made so many feel so many emotions. This version evokes no emotions for the characters or story. It\\'s more of a mindless semi nostalgic watch. As someone who has watched the animated show i approached the live action as something on its own not immediately comparing everything to the animated show. I was actually surprised, The CGI is great and that was something that bothered me with most live action adaptations of animated shows. The cast. The casting is something that is the most mehh about this live adaptation, If you are new to the whole avatar franchise not knowing about the animated version you\\'d still find it off I believe because some of the actors who portray villains are just to kind looking. That being said the actor playing Sokka would play a great Zuko for a example. About the writing for this TV Show they did a good job with the pace and especially the dialogue, Aswell with the filler scenes that we didn\\'t get in the animated but that were mentioned in the animated. That\\'s why i give it a 7 out of a 10. Netflix did a good job on this one, My compliments. The directors took liberties just so they can say it was their own. Storyline is horrible. Graphics are good and cast is ok. The cast looked like they belonged in this world. The acting from some were hit and miss. They mushed together multiple stories, from all over the original storyline, into one or two episodes. These are pivotal parts of the story that help the viewer grow with the characters. They had plenty of time to tell the entire story of the original version and then some. They decided to make up and mix up stuff for the live action instead. The bending visuals are fantastic, though. That makes it worth watching just once. I do not want a season 2. To improve on perfection is impossible. But this show does a hell of a good job of trying to keep up.\\n\\nFirstly we are spoiled by modern VFX. The fight choreography and bending CGI is nothing short of spectacular.\\n\\nThe show did an incredibly good job telling certain stories like Sokka and Zuko.\\n\\nThe writing for Ang was a bit off. They forgot they were writing for a wise child and the actor simply doesn\\'t deliver a lot of the dialogue well.\\n\\nKatara is a badass but the show glosses over her bending journey turning her into a Mary Sue, which is a shame.\\n\\nOverall a great adaptation condensing lots of story. I watched the first episode yesterday and can\\'t bring myself to continue.\\n\\nThe show has very good costumes, sets (real and virtual), the visual effects are quite decent, but it\\'s all ruined by awful script and directing. While watching this I had a constant feeling that the script-writers and directors were underqualified for a production of this size. I\\'m going to explain why I think that below, so if you\\'re just intrested in whether you should give it a try - no you shouldn\\'t. It doesn\\'t matter if you\\'re a fan of the originals or not - the show just doesn\\'t deliver what it promised.\\n\\nMy main gripe with writing/directing is that it rushes or skips entirely important things (such as character development) and instead wastes it on needless plot events. For example, during the first 20 minutes we get 3 backstory introductions. One is a 10 minute scene where the Firelord explains his evil plan, second when we see his plan in action and third when our protagonist\\'s grandma explains it to us (which is taken verbatim from the original show\\'s intro). All of this before we even start caring about what\\'s happening. In the meantime we get only the most basic character introductions.\\n\\nI have more issues with this show but without resolving this main problem they\\'re not even worth mentioning. ....they should have spent more on casting.\\n\\nI mean, auditions, they probably aren\\'t cheap, but it\\'s better than just casting people because they look a certain way. THE ACTING IS AWFUL. Ok you can kind of forgive the kids.. they\\'re particularly bad but they\\'re kids.. but the adults aren\\'t much better either.\\n\\nWhen adults or kids are giving long exposition dumps and the camera cuts back and forth and here and there and the dialogue changes volume and tempo, yeah, that\\'s too hide the awful performances. If the actors were capable of actually acting, they could leave the camera rolling and have longer takes of matched up dialogue.\\n\\nBut .. anywho.\\n\\nThe CGI is shoddy, there\\'s YouTube channels producing better CGI on a fraction of the budget.\\n\\nThe greenscreening is awful, particularly in the first episode with a boat, it looks like something from a 90s kids show.\\n\\nIs it worth a watch? Meh. Not really.\\n\\nThe cartoon exists, it may be older, but it is absolutely leagues ahead of this.\\n\\nCringe, bad effects, awful acting from the people cast because they look like the cartoon counter parts. Just finished watching, the best part is the VFX and amazing visuals. The last Airbender is nothing sort of compilation of same old stories of fighting a ruthless enemy and saving the world. It\\'s same old cookies in new pack. Though with superior VFX it\\'s good to watch. Amazing visuals is the USP of this series. Action sequences are awesome, acting is good , Aang is cute.\\n\\nStory telling technique is same old fashioned. Humour is missing. It\\'s a fast moving series with excellent action scenes. Adaptation is same from its animated show, something new added would have been great. Going for 7 stars , Watch it for mesmerising visualisation. I wasn\\'t really sure about this show since I was pretty much disappointed by another netflix\\'s live action adaptation, One Piece. Many people probably don\\'t agree with me, but for me, one piece was very juvenile and cartoony - even the costumes in the show were cartoonish. It was just another animation with real people. Why bother making a live action adaptation if they aren\\'t gonna apply a real life seriousness into it? I can\\'t lie that kids did enjoy One piece a lot. The reason why I have \"reviewed\" One piece so far here is because Avatar: The Last Airbender is complete opposite. I could see a lot of seriousness and efforts all over the show including the costumes. CGI on the world building and fight scenes is quite seamless. Those effects of bending elements in the fight scenes are very convincing. The overall production is quiet impressive, and sure enough to entertain mature audience. This show can easily rank in top netflix shows of all time. It\\'s hundred miles better than One piece, and million miles better than Shyamalan\\'s Avatar. There are some cons of the show of course, and acting skills from some of the actors were questionable at some moments. If I have to pick one con of the show, Katara in the show is way, way off from the original animation character. The visuals were top notch, the stylistic choices were good too. I think it\\'s unfair to expect a live-action version of something to be the same as the cartoons, the whole point of it is to make it different. If people want to see the cartoon, go watch that. The things I disliked most about this series was the acting/actor choices for some roles. The azula squad was really bland in their acting, they played the same character it felt like, and there was no distinction apart from their dialogue. Also the acting of Katara was pretty bad.\\n\\nZuko, Aang (mostly for his age it was impressive), Suki and Yue their acting really carried the show. While the opening of the first episode was great exceeded my expectations. I love the visuals on the choreography of the bending, it was phenomenal, great. My problem is the words exchanging from one character to the other; that is what the live action fails in.\\n\\nThe casting for Aang was done great even though he is a child actor and everyone wants to be soft but I\\'ve seen great child actors and there\\'s a lot of work to be done there.\\n\\nFor me the only person\\'s who excels in the acting roles would be Prince Zuko, Princess Azula even the cabbage man did a good job, Commander Lee also did a great job. I thought the owl was poorly placed but good voice over.\\n\\nThe share-shoe mercenary did a great job.\\n\\nSuki was I think one of the best casting and I like the fact that Suki\\'s mother appeared and she was the overseer of the village and once was a kyoshi warrior well done in that aspect.\\n\\nAnd I can\\'t forget about Appa and Momo the CGI and visuals captures them really great well done.\\n\\nNow for the deplorable directing and casting that I just cannot stand.\\n\\nAdmiral Zhao is the worst! He comes across as a puppet. Admiral Zhao in the animated version, is confident cocky fearless, this man does not care and he gives off this intimidating aura. They missed the mark on Admiral Zhao because he could have been the star of the first season.\\n\\nThey also missed the mark on Fire Lord Ozai. I think he could have been more mysterious, devious, there should have been a more evil look to him. In the live action adaptation he is too well spoken. There is just something about the way he says things even though it\\'s supposed to come across as malicious, stern and even condescending it comes across as polite which fire Lord Ozai is not polite.\\n\\nThey failed with so many other characters but Fire Lord Ozai and Admiral Zhao the ones that stand out. Hopefully the acting improves. I would love them to keep the maturity but also take some insights on the comments and rating of the first season. Wow okay, as a huge huge Avatar fan introduced to the show as a kid, I think this show is the best possible remake we can hope to get. Remakes inherently aren\\'t going to be a 1 to 1 direct copy, which I think people just need to adjust their expectations to a bit.\\n\\nI initially had holdbacks for any/all changes to the show, but when thinking such changes through after episodes, they truly do make sense with the overall through line the show is developing. I love the first season of the animated show but this live action version certainly does a better job of establishing a consistent plot/flow throughout the season (the animated season does have a lot of filler episodes, which I lovingly admit).\\n\\nThe writers also clearly didn\\'t make changes Willy Nilly, but with love and care. They reference loved aspects of the show they weren\\'t able to fit in and even tie in tiny details from the comics. It\\'s honestly fun to see the nods to the show we all love. And then they also do some of the most iconic scenes from the show almost exactly one to one (like the Masks episode was perfection).\\n\\nAnother gripe I consistently see is from others is on tone and humor. I honestly think this is a very reasonable change that suits the live action format. It\\'s like they made a more realistic version of the original for the now-adult fans to enjoy. The GAang has experienced so much hardship and trauma - and it shows. While I do miss a lot of Aang\\'s bubbly nature, we do still see it peek through and his changes make a lot of sense for a kid who has just lost his entire people. I honestly think it might be a strength of the live action to be able to have that darkness that a kids show for Nickelodeon couldn\\'t.\\n\\nAnd speaking of characters, the casting for me is fantastic: Sokka is perfect (me literally SCREAMInG at the Sokka-Suki scene - be still my beating heart omg). Zuko is such a perfect angsty teenager, with Azula being acted so well. I love Katara\\'s clear growth over the season and am excited to see these actors, especially the younger actors like Katara and Aang\\'s, settle and grow into their roles in hopefully a second season.\\n\\nThose are just the parts I feel like I need to defend, but the bending and art of the season is absolutely beautiful (even coming from me a CGI hater). The fight scenes are gorgeous and Appa and Momo are utterly adorable. And Hei-Bei?? So well done.\\n\\nOverall, I think it a truly enjoyable show that was made with so much quality and love. Of course I have my small gripes here and there but I don\\'t think that negates the positives of the show. I hope people can watch with open minds and a bit kinder hearts: it may have changes but at its core, it\\'s creating and expanding the atla world in ways we never would have gotten without the show. As a fandom who grew up with the lessons of adaptability and inclusivity from the original show, we should try to love this new version as just that, its own version.\\n\\nI\\'m utterly excited to rewatch and for a second season!! If you\\'ve made it this far, thanks for reading :) I wanted to like this show so bad but unfortunately I couldn\\'t. The first episode was decent but soon after we encounter a lot of examples of bad and stiff acting that just don\\'t make the scenes or the whole show flow and it really does affect your enjoyment of it. Most of the visuals are pretty good, the location cgi designs and the creature designs were great and bending vfxs weren\\'t too bad either. The final avatar state scene was actually pretty well made which impressed me. Still, because of the way the story was developed and the poor performances I lost interest and probably wouldn\\'t watch season 2. I didn\\'t have high expectations after the 2010 movie adaption but this exceeded all expectations. I was hooked by ep 1. The cast is finally accurate (love the cast), and the visuals are stunning! Everytime a new location is showed I just go \"WOW\"!\\n\\nIt\\'s extremely funny and not stiff at ALL. I think the show manages to balance seriousness with comedy amazingly. Sokka and Zuko are hilarious and play their characters so so well. I also love the genuine relationship between Zuko and Iroh. Katara and Aang are just adorable and we love them! Even little side characters like the guys who sing secret tunnel or cabbage guy, it\\'s perfect. I even like how some of the bad guys can still make me laugh. That\\'s when I know something is well written, when bad guys can crack jokes through sarcasm. I can go on and on about the cast and characters, but that would take all day so let me move on.\\n\\nThe characters have a lot of depth and it\\'s not just all happy. Some scenes give me chills, tears even.\\n\\nAnd the story flows along and doesn\\'t feel forced. I watched the cartoon avatar around 2 years ago in 2022 I think, and I\\'ve forgotten most of it, but everytime something happens in the live action I am immediately reminded. Each episode contains core story and gives chronological progression accurately. I love small details that reference the cartoon like Aang\\'s air bending move where he floats on a ball and crashes into a rock, Jet with the little stick in his mouth (my sister and I litteraly screamed when that happend).\\n\\nThere\\'s not a moment where I feel bored because I love avatar the cartoon and this is it, it\\'s litteraly a perfect live action. This show is really great and out of all the shows I\\'ve seen on Netflix, this one has to be in my top 5! Well done guys, can\\'t wait to see more of this. I just know this one took a lot of effort and the cast and crew really outdone themselves. The story is fantastic, the characters already established are fantastic, it has a Netflix sized budget/production at its disposal, it even has a predecessor to look towards in terms of what not to do to be better and yet the acting of the younger characters is what really holds this show from being great. The script also is wooden at times and over explains rather than shows you that emotion, payoff, etc. Every episode had its moment to shine and some did while others felt like it was being rushed, made, or acted by mediocrity. I sure hope they focus on getting the younger cast to ask more authentic rather than sounding like they are reciting lines for a play. Fingers crossed! I see several negative reviews, mainly from people comparing this new series to the original animated series (let\\'s pretend that horrible motion picture misstep did not occur), but recreating the animated version scene-by-scene in a live action production would be as stupid as recreating Hitchcock\\'s \"Psycho\" scene-by-scene....\\n\\nOh, wait....someone actually did that, didn\\'t they? And see how well THAT turned out?\\n\\nI greatly enjoyed the original Nickelodeon series, and we have re-watched it many times, so it was with some trepidation that we began watching this series. It quickly became apparent that the people involved with this new series have the same affection for the original as we do. The casting is spot-on (although I do miss Mako\\'s grown as Uncle Iroh), the storyline rings true, the performances are outstanding, and the effects - which bring \"bending\" to life - are fabulous.\\n\\nThe only problem: the wait for the next season of episodes. One of my primary gauges of success for a motion picture or a series is whether I am wishing for more at the conclusion (still wishing for a sequel to \"Master And Commander\"!); this first season definitely \"set the hook\" and has us wanting more! Well, after the 2023 writer strike, this series felt like a very welcome viewing.\\n\\nIts got pacing issues , like sometime from one episode to the next , i was wondering about the transition. Some reviewer said its like 20 episode condensed in 8, wt critiqued alterations to characters and events. The original writers had a fight wt netflix about not following their stories.\\n\\nStill, it was definitely above average in everything. Sure i wish they would have followed the original anime , but that would be so many episodes,wt effects and crew, hard to make it profitable.\\n\\nI think they will make more seasons to complete the story but the kids and teenage actors will grow n change a lot, not sure how that will effect like a season 3, maybe the avatar will have facial hair ha ha.\\n\\nSeriously, for all the complains it get on imdb, and short 8 episodes(they should have go for 13), i would recommend this series to all lovers of fantasy and magic. Effects are good, acting is fine, it really feel like The last air bender world buil. Can have beed lots worse. Would hgave been great if original writers and netflix had agree together but that would have required big money investors or money launderers to injects lotssss of money. This looks like a fan made youtube film, everything looks cheap, the acting is worse than the shaymalan version. Characters are super dumb, no development. Story feels rushed, pure exposition. No character resembles their cartoon counterpart, they seem to read off the learned script on button. Zukos actor is deffinetly the best and rescues the entire show. We see scenes filling plot holes no one asked to fill. The og series was deeper and more mature, this one relays on cheesy cgi battles, no philosophical agenda behind anything. Kids might like it, remembers me on \"mystic knights of tir na nog\", same cathegory. As a fan of the original that I have watched way too many times, the nostalgia was good. I even laughed out loud a few times!\\n\\nHowever\\n\\nThere are moments where the acting feels way too robotic/stiff, some lines are just so blocky that I don\\'t even blame the actors. Now, I know that voice acting and acting are not the same, but the lack of emotion is very present.\\n\\nI do acknowledge that we all hold the show to very high standards due to the Nickelodeon version being very special to most of us.\\n\\nBut what makes the original show so amazing was the story telling, the emotion that the voice actors conveyed to us and the story. If this show didn\\'t have the original show to depend on, I don\\'t know if I would rate it as high, as I said, nostalgia is a big factor.\\n\\nI miss uncle Iroh\\'s quotes. The best fantasy TV Series I\\'ve seen, and I\\'ve seen a lot. Every main character and even some of the secondary characters in the series are pleasant to watch, Every story is well done, Not too heavy, with humor and action in every episode. Not to mention the spectacular landscapes and imaginary cities, the various imaginary creatures and the special effects...\\n\\nAfter so many disappointments from the fantasy and fantasy TV Series that have been made over the last few years, arrives this diamond of a fantasy TV Series, unlike other heavy, clumsy and mostly boring fantasy TV Series, made in the last years and during the last two decades, It is simply a pleasure to watch it and you don\\'t want it to endA. Not to mention A second season, which is obviously the most requested, and soon please.\\n\\nIt is simply an almost perfect fantasy TV Series, because there is no such thing as perfect. But this series, for me at least, has as few disadvantages as possible and as many advantages as possible, and I recommend anyone who likes action and fantasy to watch it. You will have a lot of fun and want more...\\n\\nMay all the other creators of fantasy and fantasy TV Series learn from its creators, This is how it is done right, so that your viewers will enjoy watching it and not suffer from it and wish it would end already.\\n\\nWell done! The series is way better than the movie, but sometimes feels just as a copy of the animation. Which is ok, I\\'m glad that they respected the source material, but some additional emotions/conversations could\\'ve helped the arcs. Everything felt too monotonic, robotic.\\n\\nOn the other hand, the VFX and sounds are top notch!! Some people find the casting problematic, I\\'m in the middle on this one, I loved Iroh\\'s and Sokka\\'s actors, the rest may need a bit more time.\\n\\nI hope there will be more seasons, for me the Book 2 and 3 very way better in the animation series as well, i did not enjoy Book 1 that much, so I think from this point the series will just improve. I thoroughly enjoyed the series and believe that people are overly critical of it. The original cartoon set incredibly high expectations, but it\\'s important to recognize that the cartoon and the current adaptation have different formats. The cartoon was structured in an episodic manner, where each episode could be enjoyed on its own. However, when translating that to a serialized Netflix narrative, it becomes challenging to maintain the same level of childlike charm that some found in Book 1. Despite this, I believe the creators did an excellent job of serializing the story while still incorporating elements from the original cartoon, including some of the filler stories. It\\'s crucial to understand that this is an adaptation of the original story, and as such, there will naturally be narrative differences. Ultimately, it\\'s still Avatar at its core. I encourage you to give it a chance and approach it with an open mind. You\\'ll find numerous instances where they reference other episodes, elements from the comics, and even Korra. Rest assured, the people behind the show are genuine fans themselves. I am a huge fan of the OG cartoon and I think it is one of the best written animated stories ever.\\n\\nWhile Shyamalan\\'s adaptation was horrible, this is just disappointing.\\n\\nIt does not capture any of the spirit from the original. It is boring and jumbled. They took random parts of the original story and just mushed them together into one huge mess.\\n\\nStarting of the show had a red flag for me because they used a part of the story from one of the best and most important episodes in the animated version (The Storm) and used it in the beginning without any of the weight the OG episode holds.\\n\\nFX are not grreat but are good.\\n\\nActing is very bad, specially for the Aang character. Dialogs are very generic, story is so forced and without any depth or emotions.\\n\\nSokka character is so stipped down to its basics and is not really a character at all. Katara does not have anything that resembles the one from the OG show. The girl who had to grow up too fast and gets a huge responsibility thrown at her to look out for her brother. And she was one of the great examples of strong female characters done, not just right, but great.\\n\\nIroh does not have any of the goofy old man and the wise one characteristics. Zuko is kind of OK, but his dialogs are also very bland.\\n\\nAlthough I never expected this to be as good as the original show, and after really liking the trailes, I did not expect it to be so lazy and removed of any depth or emotions.\\n\\nLast 3 episodes I watched in about 6 minutes while skipping most of it.\\n\\nI dont think I will come back to season 2. For the amount of episodes they had been given, they truly did the best they could, some of the characters are spot on and their inexperience truly add value to the series. Which is amazing.\\n\\nThe visuals are beyond. I am a fan of king Bumi now especially because he was played masterfully. I love that we got some awnsers that we haven\\'t seen in the original series as well.\\n\\nI do however need to get over the the aesthetics of the firenation a litle. In the original they look quite a bit different because sunburn and such doesn\\'t effect them. So i feel they missed the mark on their native aesthetics which is a bit of a shame. But besides that detail, i do think Zuko\\'s mannerisms and voice are spot on. So well done.\\n\\nIn the original series the firelord and azula are a lot more malicious (like hannibal silence of the lambs kind of vibes). But here they decided to make them a bit softer, almost more relatable. Which make them lose their wicked kind of charm.\\n\\nHopefully they will get there in the following seasons!\\n\\nEven tho i do have some thoughts about it.\\n\\nI still give the series a 10!\\n\\nLike i said i feel like they tried to put an aweful lot of imported puzzlepieces vital to the series in that short amount of episodes and still find ways to tribute legendary moments from the original series to the main storyline,as well be a show on its own.\\n\\nI don\\'t think they could have done much better! Huge fan of the original series! It\\'s my favorite show. It\\'s actually all of my siblings favorite show! So much I got a sibling tattoo with the avatar elements! Sooo needless to say, I was excited about this new show! Yes a little nervous because when something is so great, you wonder why even mess with it! Lol buuuut I thought they did a great job! The casting is just spot on for most of them! There\\'s only like 2 characters that I\\'m not huge fans of and it\\'s not even a big enough deal for me to name them.\\n\\nAnd yes they changed some of the storyline, but honestly I loved all the changes they made!\\n\\nAlso some of the acting isn\\'t the best..... but overall l truly enjoyed the show! I would definitely recommend it!\\n\\nReady for season two!! \"Avatar: The Last Airbender\" season 1 (2024) is a beautiful live action adaptation of the animated \"Avatar: The Last Airbender\" (2005). Of course only season one has been remade and it is gonna be a while for season 2 of 3.\\n\\nThe casting can be compared to the casting of \"Stranger Things\" (2016). An all young cast with upcoming actors who will be in the hands of Netflix for the foreseeable future. I myself have little to no comments on the cast, they are all doing an incredible job and i can\\'t wait to see more of them on my screen.\\n\\nIt has always been hard to remake an already beloved show that barely has any flaws, they tried to do this with \"The Last Airbender\" (2010) but this was a big flop and did not do well. I am really glad they did not give up on doing this and tried again. They just did so much better this time around.\\n\\nEverything looked really well done, the visual and practical effects were amazing and they really brought the world of Avatar: the last airbender alive.\\n\\nOne of my favorite things about this show was the music. Takeshi Furukawa did such an amazing job, using little bits and pieces from the original show it brought tears to my eyes sometimes. The goosebumps were constant for me while watching this.\\n\\nI cannot wait for the seasons to come and look forward to it so much!\\n\\nGood job Netflix! I did not finish this show. I watched the first two episodes before quitting. Thus, I am not giving it a number score. This is one of the most lifeless, passionless shows I\\'ve ever seen. This was not made because someone had a vision for what a live action Last Airbender should look like, this was made to capitalize on how popular the cartoon became once it went to Netflix. The acting is bad, the costumes look bad, the effects are mostly bad, and it has some incredibly goofy moments. The raid on the air temple in the beginning have a few, one where fire benders fly up a cliff, which looks like nuclear warheads launching. Another in which an air bender creates a tornado, only for fire benders to light said tornado and the air bender comically screams. Another huge issue is the order in which the story is told. Whoever wrote this probably saw Pulp Fiction and said \"why is it all out of order?\" Having the monks reveal to Aang that he\\'s the avatar on top of showing the air temple raid immediately raise the stakes higher than they should be. Part of what made the beginning of the original series great was the reveal that the air genders were all dead, it seamlessly introduced grim elements into a series that had previously been entirely lighthearted. Also there\\'s this weird issue with fire bending where it basically functions like air. People will get engulfed in flames, only to be shown with slightly tattered clothes and dirt on their face. I know the show isn\\'t looking to be crazy violent but some amount of realism there would be an improvement. I don\\'t plan on finishing this series, but from what I hear it at least doesn\\'t completely butcher the source material like the previous live action movie did. But that doesn\\'t mean you should watch this. Half of what makes the cartoon series so great is that is was animated, and trying to translate that energy into live action was what made this and the live action movie feel so awkward. I really enjoyed how Netflix adapted One Piece so I thought this would be good in good hands. I hate to admit this, but I actually prefer the movie from 2010 and that\\'s not saying much. It\\'s not the worst thing I\\'ve seen, but the acting from the majority of the cast, including the leads, leaves much to be desired. The CGI and costumes also do not look as a movie over that is already done a decade old. I made it to episode 4 before deciding I was disappointed and turned it off. I didn\\'t hate it, but it was serving as background noise as I played in my phone. It was less than engaging, which is unfortunate, because it could have had the opportunity to have some food fight sequences and manipulation of the elements. Netflix missed the mark with this one. Recap. This series has always had high expectations and even higher apprehention. Music and graphics are tight. Even these 1 star reviews can\\'t deny that.\\n\\nEp1 was a little iffy. I was unsure abt the acting. Everything seemed a bit staged and stiff. I couldn\\'t concentrate on the storyline and as a big Aang gang fan I was worried. As the episodes progressed they got better and better. By ep4 they had me in happy tears. I give this show an 8/10. Good job guys. I love it.\\n\\nNothing is as ever as good as the original, and with such devoted fans this series will always been impossible under such heavy weight. Y\\'all did great. Avatar The Last Airbender really doesn\\'t have a place or business being a live action adaptation and they really shouldn\\'t have tried this AGAIN! After the Shyamalan disaster, WHY??? The only thing I will give it props for is going in a different direction with its story than the anime show originally did by showing the downfall of the Air temple/Aang\\'s home. I admire the different spin on some things, and how SOME of the bending looks and how they made an effort to make the characters look like their originals. Thankfully the rest of this just reminds us of how special and great the animated show was. What I hate about this: poor acting/performances, BAD CGI when Aang flies through the air and the \"camera\" shows him up close, how bad/dark/thick Aang\\'s eyebrows look, and how completely unexciting it is. My friends may watch more of this since they\\'re real Avatar nerds, but I\\'m feeling so meh about it. NOT the kind of show I feel like watching more of...and not really sorry about it. 1. Overall Plot - 9/10 The overall plot is pretty much the same from the cartoon. Little story details get changed or moved around, but nothing in a way that ruins it. It is all still very good.\\n\\nThey don\\'t mention sozins comet as the time frame for the show like the cartoon does. This is because they have to account for the actors aging. So it\\'s OK because there is a legit reason to do it.\\n\\n2. Entertainment / Engagement - 9/10 The whole show is very entertaining. The first episode is a bit boring and cheesy. But with every episode it just gets better and better.\\n\\nBecause it\\'s the same overall story, so you know the outcome, but some of the details are changed, it\\'s still engaging to watch, because it\\'s still something new and fresh.\\n\\n3. Emotion / Investment in Story - 8/10 Zuko carries the emotion in this. His development, and how we learn and sympathize with his character is so good. They did a great job bringing his character into live action.\\n\\nOther characters do a good job showing their emotions, but nothing really makes you feel to much for them as much as Zuko.\\n\\nBecause of the things they change, it keeps you heavily invested, even knowing the outcome. Which I thing is great to keep people watching and wanting more.\\n\\n4. Theme and Depth of Story - 9/10 I\\'d say the theme of this season is determination and accepting who you are. We see this with almost all the main characters as they develop.\\n\\nThis story is super deep. Especially with Zuko. There is a lot to learn, and I\\'m excited about the future seasons.\\n\\n5. Characters - 8/10 They nailed most of the characters. Something to keep in mind with the characters is that this live action version isn\\'t a kids show like the cartoon, so the characters are gonna inevitably be a little different. Azula was introduced early on in the season and plays a small part in the plot. This is a change from the cartoon, as she didn\\'t appear until the last episode of the season. But I think they did a good job with it.\\n\\nThere\\'s really only three problems I have with the characters. The first is Sokka. His character is by far the most different. He is a lot more serious, and makes a ton less jokes. But that is also part of it not being a kids show so I don\\'t think it\\'s terrible. And he still has his Sokka moments. I also wish he used his boomerang more since it\\'s part of his iconic character.\\n\\nThe next is Admiral / Commander Zhao. His character is completely different. I think it\\'s just the way the actor plays it, but he has a completely different demeanor to him. It is also changed a bit because he works with Azula, which doesn\\'t happen in the cartoon. Keep in mind, that just because his character is changed a bit, doesn\\'t mean it is bad. I still enjoyed it.\\n\\nThe third change I noticed was pretty small. It\\'s with Aang. He spends most of the season not wanting to accept that he\\'s the Avatar, or complaining that he failed ad the Avatar. While in the cartoon he just gets over it a lot sooner.\\n\\n6. Acting / Writing - 6/10 Most the actors do good, but not great. They don\\'t do anything bad, but just don\\'t do anything spectacular either.\\n\\nI actually think Zuko\\'s actor nailed him. It might seem like he complains and whines too much, but that is how Zuko started out. He is just a moody teenager after all.\\n\\nAll the writing was pretty good. There was a few cringy and cheesy parts, but that was really only in the first few episodes.\\n\\n7a. Cinematography - 4/10 The usual Netflix cinematography. They just make everything so dark and grainy. And I hate that. Some scenes look to bland, while others look to busy as well.\\n\\nThe characters outfits look too new as well. Sometimes they just look out of place and too cartoony for the vibe of the show.\\n\\n7b. Choreography - 10/10 I\\'m adding this as a separate section because of how good it was. All of the bending looks freakin sick. I think they made it look as good as it can get. Especially when compared to the crappy bending in the movie.\\n\\n8. Score - 9/10 I love how they brought a lot of the original music back. The score of the cartoon is perfect and amazing. I just wish they used it a little bit more, and less of the new music. The new music is still good though.\\n\\n9. Editing / Pace - 9/10 They did a great job editing this. All of the fights are edited good, and feel intense. There is also some very cool transitional shots that I loved.\\n\\nThe pace is also very great. Because it\\'s a live action, you cannot pace it the same as a cartoon. It just doesn\\'t work. But they didn\\'t cut anything you wouldn\\'t want them too. This show feels like it was made by people who love the cartoon. So the pacing is great.\\n\\n10. VFX/Practical Effects - 8/10 All of the special effects are super good. All of the bending looks super real and cool.\\n\\nThe only thing that is noticeably bad is when Aang is in the Avatar State. They do some closeup shots of his face, and the CGI looks bad. It honestly looks like a videogame cutscene. But that\\'s because it\\'s a Netflix show, so it doesn\\'t have the highest budget ever.\\n\\nAverage Score: 8.1/10\\n\\nMy Overall Rating and Final Thoughts: 8.7/10 I actually really liked this show. I think they did a good job of remaking it. If you think of it as a live action version of the cartoon, it\\'s going to suck, and you\\'ll hate it. But if you think of it as a fan that remade the series using all the same plot points and details in live action, then it is great. I am fine with how it is changed and in a bit of a different order from the original. At first I didn\\'t like it, but then it got better. Episodes 4, 5, and 6 are so freakin good. If you like the cartoon then definitely give this a watch. Just have an open mind about it, because nothing will ever be as good as the original. And even if you don\\'t like it at first, keep watching. It gets so much better. The series looks better than I ever imagined. They nailed the architecture and looks of each civilization exceptionally well, especially with the Air Nomads and the fire nation. Also they expanded the world with new stories which fitted in very well and were overall interesting for an avatar fan. The acting and characters of suko, iroh and general zaoh was convincing and made me wanna see more of them.\\n\\nBUT the main cast of Sokka, Katara and Aang came very short. They didn\\'t get many scenes to bond or to show their friendship. Also we didn\\'t see much of their personality\\'s and traits. Their chemistry wasn\\'t very convincing so I had a lot of problems believing that they had formed such a strong bond in such a short time.\\n\\nOverall this series is pretty good. It expands the aviator story in a positive way and interprets the story in a new way which I really liked. The series seemed kinda rushed despite being announced a couple of years ago. Weak actors, but nice special effects, it seems that they cared more about making cool visuals, and not really focusing on the story itself, a huge letdown. Even the humor is weak. The movie did a better job than this series, and even the movie was a huge letdown. I watched all of the episodes at the course of an evening/night, and I wouldnt even give it a second watch, the animated series is way more enjoyable and actually rewatchable\\n\\nThe cartoon does a way better job and actually uses correct timelines unlike the live action series. Seeing a rating of 7.5 honestly got my hopes up, I thought that similar to One Piece this will also be a solid show, which while not a 1to1 copy of the source, will be a solid retelling.\\n\\nWhile this is a vast improvement over the older attempts at Avatar the Last Airbender, The fight scenes are great, well choreographed. Couple that with decent CGI and you get a very fun show. However, where it falls flat is choosing which parts to show and pace things properly. The acting is also absolutely abysmal, I find it hard to believe they could not find a more talented lead child actor with how many people start taking lessons early nowadays. The dialogues are also written very poorly. There seems to be a real disconnect between the teams and quality of people working behind them.\\n\\nCould it be worse? Sure. However, it is also not deserving of being called good. It is your average middle of the pack retelling of a famous media piece. Reminded me of my childhood, how I used to enjoy watching the cartoon... It\\'s truly a masterpiece.. hope it has a season 2... All the casts have played their characters well.. the story, the cinematography, action everything was in place.. I don\\'t understand less stars from others, wish I could have given more... The way they have portrayed the characters is really good.. The main character Aang played his role really well... Really can\\'t wait for a SEASON 2 if they have it in their mind... Recommended and a must watch to relive childhood memories, it\\'s really an amazing series 10 stars to this masterpiece.. We all waited for this to come out -- in the light of the 2010 M. Knight Shyamalan version. If you enjoyed the cartoon (albeit, ok, watching it with your kids) -- no live live action production will ever pass muster. Did I enjoy it? Yes. Apart from watching all of the world events unfolding in our day and age, this was a nice escape departure. Not everyone will love or appreciate what it takes to create such production. Imagine re-creating \"Speed Racer\" in live action. You\\'d hate it, right? Spritle and Chimpkin wouldn\\'t ever be \"funny enough\" or the ubiquitous \"the front circular saws on the Mach-5 can\\'t really cut trees like that\"... The producers knew that risk and ran with it. Enjoy these for what they are: e-n-t-e-r-t-a-i-n-i-n-g recreations. Geez, reading some of these negative reviews makes you think whether they have bothered to watched the Netflix series at all. The visual was amazing, the casting was almost spot on with a couple of exceptions, but overall, really really pleased and loved every moment of this adaptation. If you want to watch a like for like, then just watch the original animation instead.\\n\\nThis series really captures the essence of the original animation - friendship, humour and how each character develops over time. There are true moments that brings tears to my eyes. Highly rate Aang and Zuko as the 2 best characters and their acting so far.\\n\\nEnjoy this with open mind instead and ignore the negative reviews. You can give these people a gold bar and they\\'ll still think it\\'s worthless.\\n\\nCannot wait for Book 2, in the meantime, I\\'ll rewatch again as I binged all 8 episodes in 1 go and may have missed some of the details.\\n\\n******* Update\\n\\nOmg!! Some 1 star ratings because they saw the trailer and the skin tone of Sokka and Katara were too pale and not enough diversity, so they decided to give the low rating without even bothered watching the series, this is just another level of ignorance and says it all. They are certainly open to their opinions, but it\\'s like having a sniff of your food without tasting it and just throw it away, unbelievable. Avatar: The Last Airbender Netflix version is a bit of a mixed bag; on one hand it fails to capture the magic of the original series, on the other hand it seems to stay very loyal to the source material from first watch. The best way to look at this show is from an open mind, there is no other way.\\n\\nLet\\'s dive into the world of Avatar by examining pros and cons, we\\'ll focus on the pros first: The visual effects are stunning and look most impressive, same for the entire world and locations created from story board to screen. In general everything that has to do with the surroundings is at a most high level and I appreciate the care for detail.\\n\\nIn terms of story, it seems the creators decided to go with a \\'Game of Thrones\\' approach: political games, schemes and backstabbing, wars and careful planning. I for once am in favor of this approach and believe it fits well the world of Avatar (after all, there is war in the show, people die).\\n\\nZuko\\'s arc is very well crafted, mostly because it is the most interesting of the show (both original and Netflix). From being a banished prince to a man and leader of his own destiny. Dallas Liu portrays him very well and overall it seems he\\'s the only character amongst the others who wasn\\'t harmed by the script.\\n\\nThere are other good things to say about the show but for now we\\'ll move to the cons: The biggest problem the show suffers from is that the creators focus mainly on the story and not the characters. In the original series, you had many filler episodes that focused on the dynamics: the episode Tales of Ba Sing Se, when the Gaang get lost in the caves with the group of hippies; Zuko and Azula going on a summer vacation with their friends.\\n\\nYou have many examples of character dynamics; Katara and Toph arguing, Zuko and uncle Iroh on the run throughout Book 2. There are Also moments when the characters are just acting silly. I feel all those little dynamics were absent throughout the show it could have added much more depth.\\n\\nBecause there were no filler episodes, there was no real chance at diving into the characters, after all Aang, Katara and Sokka are basically kids, so why not show them as kids having fun? ATLA is a show about kids on a journey, about friendship. Imagine the movie \\'Stand by me\\' only at war times.\\n\\nAnother big problem the show suffers from is the pacing, this season alone is only 8 episodes, for a show like Avatar it is way too rushed. In one episode alone we were introduced to King Bumi, Jet and The Mechanist. I know Netflix couldn\\'t make a full season of 20 episodes of live action ATLA. It\\'s like demanding a live action version of One Piece with 100 episodes each season - in terms of budget and production it is impossible. Even a 10- or 12- part season would have been fine. I really don\\'t see the reason to rush the story and cut corners.\\n\\nIn conclusion, I feel this show overall is a fair adaptation and possibly the best version of ATLA we could have got in live action. If Netflix wants this show to really succeed, they are going to have to put more effort in the script and characters, as of now this series is far from reaching the same level of magic the original show possessed. Everything is good, although there are still some things that I feel are not quite right, such as the players who play Azula, Mai, and Ty Lee look like middle school students who like to gossip. There are several scenes that in the animation look important but in the live action version they appear, such as when Aang first became an avatar in the water and when Aang went to the Avatar Roku temple and told the world that the avatar had returned as a form of hope for peace, I also really liked it. Suki\\'s character has good chemistry with Sokka and can\\'t wait to see him again in the next story. Hopefully this live action version of Avatar TLA will be even better in the next story.🌊🌏🔥💨 To start off, I don\\'t necessarily hate the show. It was created for people who have not watched the original story, that\\'s the vibe I got.\\n\\nOne of the things that definitely bothered me was the acting. They should\\'ve not rushed the whole production and instead provided these child actors with lessons prior to having them act in a high budget show. They had potential but unfortunately, I guess that did not matter. You would have to hope to see some good acting. I believe only few actors those who were not primarily the main characters, were doing a swell job. For instance, like Bumi - the actor who portrays him is already an established actor, and he did an amazing job.\\n\\nAnother unnecessary change was the story of Omashu, now if you watch the original show, it is between a man and women - but here for some reason, it is a story between two women. Priorities, I guess.\\n\\nThis show storytelling could\\'ve been better, but it explains why the creators left.\\n\\nHowever, the effects and visual is just incredible! It makes you believe what you see could\\'ve actually what the world in Avatar could\\'ve been.\\n\\nIf I were to say, I think watching the cartoon is definitely way better. However, this is not horrible but also not the best, they could\\'ve offered better. Growing up, I never watched anime. I started of by watching this one when i was like 18, i loved it. It was amazing. The characters and story was so well written. But that\\'s it, this show is for kids. It\\'s about kids going on an adventure to stop the fire king to take over the world. Which in my opinion is like all anime\\'s. They are trying to make this like the one piece live action and it sucks cause this show will never be as good as that one.\\n\\nThey tried, but flopped heavy with this tv show. If you really want a good anime or good show to watch, go watch the live action one piece. It is way more accurately represented and the acting, cgi, everything just better. This show is for children and it should be just for that. Just finished binge watching the tv series. It had the big budget and production as i expected and it was one of the best and i think they tried to make their own vision of the series come to life but my big fat question to the creator is that why deviate from the source material at all. You could have met with a great review if you had just sticked to the script . I mean where is the ang\\'s funniness and comical presence that he had shown from the very first scene when he said to katara that \\' would you go to penguin sailing with me \\' and in the very next episode he just did with katara. Where is the saka\\'s goofied mixed reply whenever he was in scene in the anime . Where are the mini adventures that were unrelated to the mission at all. I mean you literally had a video script for this . I am happpy to have got the live action version but please and please try to stick to the anime script. Just to make myself happy and wash down the little disappointment from this series you made me again binge watch the anime version. The effects are great, performances are great, production design (blue screens/Mandalorian background tech) is great. If you\\'ve never watched anything from this IP before, you\\'re sure to have a good time.\\n\\nAs a fan of the old series, each character feels very familiar in this adaptation, so for that I praise the casting department. However, I do feel like this series did almost too much fan service. They were too afraid to make any bold new attempts in its storytelling or directorial style. It\\'s all too familiar, making me wonder... why was it rebooted in the first place if they were gonna go this route? It all just feels like the Lion King \"live-action\" film, which also didn\\'t need to be made.\\n\\nAll this series did was make me want to rewatch the animated series again, because if the live-action series continues this way, tonally speaking, there\\'s no way it will even attempt to capture the charm and artistry of its predecessor. The original Nickelodeon show has aged all too well for it to warrant a remake, even one as shiny this one.\\n\\nBut hey, Netty\\'s version, while lacking substance, is still a good time. Give it a go. Even before I watched the first episode, I had been saying it during the teasers and trailers that it should not mess up the humor because the original animation was so \"lively\" because of just that. Now after watching the disappointing first season, I can rightly say - most cookie points are lost just because of the humor.\\n\\nThe storyline wiggles at most places. Even when you try to shut the original and watch this Live Action as a new piece, characters come and go as if they are \"placed\" in the show just to give them a tribute or an honorable mention. Zhao, Bumi, The Mechanist, Jet & the Freedom Fighters, Mai, Tai Lee, Suki, Avatar Kyoshi, and other secondary characters are just there serving no purpose, sometimes making no sense also. Revealing Fire Lord Ozai was a huge risk, since he was seen in the teaser too, and now having Azula and Ozai not just seen, but also serving no purpose has made Zuko\\'s storyline blotched.\\n\\nThe White Lotus society carries a big part in the original, and here, Iroh and Bumi (ironically, together) yet don\\'t even acknowledge each other is just plain bad writing. Story of Oma and Shu, the lack of urgency of Winter Solstice, the lack of built up for up Avatar Roku, Aapa\\'s connection with Aang, everything feels haywire. Even if you close the animated chapter, and try to watch this as a separate entity, it falls flat on its face.\\n\\nMaybe Dallas Liu as Zuko fares well since he is the most driven, and even sounds like Dante Basco from the original. Ian Ousley as Sokka is watchable, bearable but his character is just plain boring. Worst are the leads, Gordon Cormier as Aang, and Kiawentiio as Katara - they lack the zeal, their character arcs look confusing, and they don\\'t behave like children but robotic adults.\\n\\nI could find little or no saving grace for this. Fight sequences are sporadic and forced, and the \"Avatar Culture\" that all of us Arrowheads are so acquainted with, is tainted. I have had enough of these Live Action, NO SEASON 2 PLEASE! I literally loved everything about this series. I know people are loyal to the cartoon and had their fingers burnt by the awful film, but this is definitely not that. It is engaging, funny and told excellently. I would highly recommend this to all viewers!\\n\\nIf I had one criticism I would say it falls off a bit halfway through, with a couple of episodes feeling a bit like \\'filler episodes\\' but this is quickly forgotten when the action begins.\\n\\nI think people who loved the original are a bit closed minded to these things but truthfully this is a good series which could be enjoyed by all if the fans of the original could just get over it haha. This is a brilliant adaptation of the original animated series, it stayed true to the animation but also put a new twist to it. Yes it\\'s not perfect but I don\\'t think anyone can expect perfection, you can see the effort the people working on the show have put into it and most of the time I can respect the work they have done. The bending looks beautiful and some of the fight scenes were even better than in the animation, the story line works and sets season 2 up perfectly. It\\'s not as good as the animation but nobody excepted that anyway, this show deserves so much credit for bringing a beloved show to life. Some of the hate on this show is ridiculous, Avatar is not for everyone but I love it and a lot of people can agree with me. I really hope this show does well and I hope we get a season 2 because all the true Avatar fans deserve it. As someone who watched the animated episodes when they dropped week after week and then rewatched them again years later when they came on streaming, I was mostly let down by the series.\\n\\nThe Special effects dept and martial arts training team did an excellent job, but like so many recent shows it tries to shoe horn in young Actors who cannot act and who basically just come across as Young LA high school students doing Cosplay.\\n\\nAll of the dialog that made the original show funny is gone!\\n\\nAll of the character building is gone!\\n\\nThe actors come across as though they are being told during filming to smile or look sad or put on a goofy face. Nothing feels natural and nothing makes me feel compelled to like these characters except for the fact that they are playing the parts of my beloved Animate Characters.\\n\\nI will give some props to the Actor who played Sokka. He was the only one that came off as at least trying hard from the start to work with the Humorless material. I did warm up to the Zuko character a bit but the original Zuko voice and characters are so Iconic that it was hard to get use to the new version of him.\\n\\nMost of the older actors were great, I especially felt like I got back the closest version of Iroh that I could hope for.\\n\\nI see no way they can fix this show short of recasting and getting new writers. The recasting part is never going to happen so I think this is going to be a slog fest for Netflix. The first 30 minutes were hard to get into. After that the show really takes off. They cast characters that really look like the characters from the original show. I loved everything about it and I\\'m blown away by the negativity. They absolutely KILLED this remake and I hope they make more. Sakka and Ang both look exactly like his anime character, down to the expressions on Sakkas forehead. The bad guys uncle was also perfectly cast. I\\'ve been waiting my whole life for a good remake of this show and I think Netflix really delivered. This was definitely tailored to the people who grew up watching and loving the original show. This live action is visually pleasing the action is quite entertaining. I enjoyed the different details. I do not enjoy these mashed up plots that have followed. The dialogue is kind of corny at times which I don\\'t mind so much as I mind the lack of comedy. The couple of times they try to have humor it doesn\\'t land. That being said because of the mashed up plot lines there\\'s details that are missing. The 8 hour 8 episodes format wasnt it.\\n\\nWhen I first heard of this live action reboot I heard confirmation the original creators were going to be involved. Turns out they and Netflix parted ways because they weren\\'t seeing eye to eye. It shows, this series compared to an almost 20 yr old cartoon is quite dumbed down and rushed. The only thing this new series has going for it is great action sequences. If you love ATLA you should skip this show ... they butchered the main characters and messed up key character building moments... changed a lot of key characteristics and added weird unnecessary stuff ... And more than anything they just couldn\\'t do sokka and uncle iroh and azula... like is itbthat hard to actually write a funny sarcastic sokka and not make him an angry a**hole.uncle iroh and azula is just flat ... where is uncle irohs charm? Where is azulas attitude her smirk the cunning words!!! They didn\\'t need to do anything extra ... the writing was already there how can you just fail twice in the same thing?? It just show they just didn\\'t even try ... just poured a lot of money for vfx thinking that will make it good automatically. I think this series is very good. It is true that this Avatar series has smaller differences compared to the animated series, but the special effects are very good and really great. I am satisfied with the choice they made for acting, but I am happy after watching the first episode. I was hyped and I am very eager for Netflix to continue this series for season 2 and 3 The series \"Avatar: The Last Airbender\" attracted me from the very beginning. What a beautiful and exciting world. The actors are great together, the fights look great and the actors are really outstanding. This series is a fun and new take on a classic and enduring work. The scenes using the elements were also shown well. Let me start off by saying that this is one of the best visually attractive works made by Netflix so if you want to have a good visual experience of a watch then I\\'d advise you to go give it a watch but that\\'s almost pretty much it. Not a lot I can say really when it comes to the story and characters except for some of the bad guys but other than that, not really interesting catching back stories for each of the \"good guys\" and not really that many details given so you wouldn\\'t really care or feel some kind of attachment to any of them so all in all, it\\'s a descent watch thanks to the gorgeous visual effects that could give you a good experience and lift up some of the boredom. This is actually a fairly decent series; I had never seen the animated series I\\'d enjoy it more. The acting is pretty good, and the writing is decent. There are some minor issues with the FX, but I\\'m emphasizing \"minor\"; I would have liked more practical effects but then Katara would have been shortchanged.\\n\\nWhile this is below the cartoon, it\\'s well above the movie on every level. If you\\'re looking for something to binge, it works, especially if you have kids.\\n\\nThere are three basic issues, but I\\'m throwing in the caveat that this is just the first season, so I\\'m expecting some issues.\\n\\n1) It\\'s trying too hard to follow the series. This isn\\'t necessarily a bad thing, but it can actually get annoying every so often. However, it does deviate from the path and fills things in with just enough frequency to make it interesting.\\n\\n2) The storytelling feels too linear: It just doesn\\'t flow like it should, and there should be more flashbacks, and the flashbacks that are there are just too brief. This is more of a personal preference, but this is one story that needs those eddies and vortices.\\n\\nThis also applies to the introduction of Azula and Co. However, I do like her introduction this early into the series, and letting her develop a little more than she was allowed to in the series. It\\'s also nice to her evilness develop.\\n\\n3) The character development is a little slow, but it is again the first season; let\\'s establish the basics first. However, I do like what they are doing with Osai; it makes him a better villain when you can see the development of his villainy contrasted with how good of a father he is.\\n\\nLike I said: This is actually a fairly decent series, and it can work outside of the original series. It\\'s well worth watching, even if you are a hardcore fan of the cartoon. Avatar: The Last Airbender (2024 TV Series) Season 1\\n\\nIn this live-action adaptation of the animated series with the same title, we follow Aang, the Avatar tasked with preserving balance between the mortal and spirit realms. His quest for peace involves thwarting the sinister schemes of the Fire Nation.\\n\\nThis adaptation endeavors to capture the essence of the animated series while introducing fresh elements and narratives, although achieving perfect balance isn\\'t always attainable.\\n\\nOn a positive note, this adaptation dazzles with breathtaking visuals and effects, showcasing a visually stunning world. The fight scenes are meticulously crafted, and although not always showcasing the diverse fighting styles of the animated series, the choreography, and presentation remain commendable.\\n\\nChange is not always accepted, especially when not done well or not being grounded in logical reasoning, and this is probably the biggest problem with this adaptation. The story told here has been reworked. New materials have been added; if stories aren\\'t merged, they\\'re imagined differently, and sometimes some storylines are tossed out. The most egregious is when the new storylines aren\\'t followed through and forgotten. Some of the new materials here are good, for example, the backstory given to Zuko\\'s character, but most will have audiences griping.\\n\\nAnother element that sticks out is the portrayal of some characters. Katara here is stripped entirely of the essence she had in the animated series, and calling her a caricature seems like praise. While it\\'s refreshing to see Azula introduced early on, her ruthless and cunning demeanor doesn\\'t fully translate. Zuko\\'s character, on the other hand, receives the most authentic portrayal, capturing all the qualities that made him beloved, and perhaps even enhancing them\\n\\nThere are other minor flaws to note. The choice of wigs for certain characters and how they\\'re installed is poor. Dialogue is poor and sometimes infused with overdrawn expositions. Another gripe here is that it seems like fun has been sucked out of this adaptation, the characters hurry from location to location and ultimately leave comedy on the chopping block.\\n\\nIn conclusion, while it may fall short of the masterpiece that is the animated series and evoke constant comparisons, this adaptation represents a positive step forward following the forgettable movie that preceded it.\\n\\n6/10. I\\'m a massive ATLA fan, ever since I was a kid. And I was super skeptical since the previous movie sucked, but I will say that it succeeded my expectations. The cgi was amazing, the visuals and the cinematography was incredible! I was pleasantly surprised, but now here comes my disappointment with the show - the acting.\\n\\nThough I definitely don\\'t want to bash the teens who probably worked so hard to act in this show, like Gordon and Kiawentiio, however some of the older actors acting was pretty bad. Not to mention the way a lot of the dialogue was presented, it almost felt emotionless, extremely corny or sometimes rushed.\\n\\nNext is the clothes and prop designs - some of the costumes were amazing, yet many were almost like a cosplay design - cheaply made and just ugly and unrealistic. It even made me laugh sometimes.\\n\\nBut otherwise, this is an amazing adaptation, and I expected something completely different and honestly, a lot worse. 1. Grats to the trailer team,much better than the end result.\\n\\n2. Failed to match the characteristics of it\\'s heroes and villains. Azula and Iroh especially.\\n\\n3. Too compact did not have time for some flow and pace just jumped all over the place.\\n\\n4. Watchable yes, does it match one piece live action no.\\n\\n5. Do I suggest it? Well for a very superficial view of the story only otherwise watch the animated show again.\\n\\nSo 6/10 as a standalone show 4/10 as an avatar show. Casting was ok with hits and misses some characters where fleshed out fine most where not, not for fans of Aank but relatively ok for \"normies\". Well done for what it sought out to be, if you\\'re going into this series hoping for a shot for shot remake of the acclaimed original then you will be let down. If however, you\\'re going in with an open mind, it\\'s a wonderful love letter to the fan base while still having its own new twists and plot points. While it\\'s not a copy of the original series, it gets to the same plot points in its own ways. Young actors could use some work on certain scenes and some changes seem unnecessary but overall, it\\'s perfect for what it\\'s meant to be. Avatar has always been a great story but cartoons aren\\'t for everyone. This series does the story justice in live action. Which is such a good feeling after having to live through the M Night Shyamalan disaster. TLDR: It\\'s good but not perfect, however compared to what we got from M. Night Shyamalan it\\'s a masterpiece.\\n\\nI\\'m an adult fan of the original series. I didn\\'t \"grow up\" with it, I was already well into adulthood when the animated show came out. I enjoyed it (loved it actually) and it ranks on my all time favorites and I personally am enjoying this adaptation. Compared to M. Night\\'s version though, it\\'s an absolute triumph. THAT version was horrible on every single level in terms of pacing, writing, acting, all of it.\\n\\nThis show has its problems but it\\'s not the dumpster fire other reviews are making out to be. The writing is a little on the nose but it\\'s not horrible. I also see other complaints about the lack of humor, changes in characterizations etc but the changes are not the end of the world IMO.\\n\\nYes, changes have been made to characters and plot points and while some of them I may not have agreed with at first, I feel the show does a good in-universe justification for them and I did get on board with the changes eventually.\\n\\nIf you were a childhood super fan who grew up with this or are expecting a shot for shot recreation from the animated series to live action, then I can see how this adaptation is disappointing. If you have an open mind and are ok with them keeping the \"spirit\" of the original animated series despite the changes then you\\'ll be fine. Again, it\\'s not perfect. . . But compared to what we got in 2010. . . .it\\'s a masterpiece.\\n\\nFinally. Iroh is still iroh. Love him in this. Let\\'s be clear. In my many reviews, over 2000, I have stated unambiguously that the original animated series is possibly the most perfect entertainment product ever to be offered in series form. (Much like Scott Adkins\\' infamous MMA film character was presented as the \"most perfect fighter.\") So how do you improve on perfection? Well, you don\\'t do it by taking a pile of cash and producing one of the worst movies in history. Shame on you, M. Night Shyamalan. This current live action adaption clearly lacks the \"secret sauce\" that touched so many hearts, young and old, in the original. However, an oasis in a desert is still not to be spurned. As modern society in this decade implodes from within, there are worse fates, especially for fans, than finally getting live-action versions of characters and events that we once could only imagine. Not perfect. But a nice way to pass a cold winter\\'s night. Yip yip. ((Designated \"IMDb Top Reviewer.\" Please check out my list \"167+ Nearly-Perfect Movies (with the occasional Anime or TV miniseries) you can/should see again and again (1932 to the present)) I don\\'t understand what they were thinking. This is incomparable to the cartoon. The acting is terrible; it is like watching a high-school play. The one thing this show did right was the effects. The characters are unlovable and unfunny. Most Characters are not anything like how they are in the cartoon. This is most true for uncle Iroh; they did him so dirty. Iroh is the polar opposite of how he is in the original. Sokka is alright; Zuko is alright. Aang is unfunny and just bad at acting. Katara isnt hot headed enough. Overall this is one of the worst possible outcomes of this tv show. Unlovable characters and bad acting. This series is 1000 times better than that movie. It doesn\\'t give the same feeling as the cartoon but it offers so much more. Am I the only one who is getting crazy happy just to see our bold monk. By the way the cast seems ok and they might be better maybe the aang but he captures the essence of the role and as for fire nation they are so on point. I liked this show and I advise everyone to see it. Please don\\'t hate on new tv series they are only made because we love the first one so much. After all this is not a failed experiment of the movie this is is much more. Sticks to story and ads more things that makes it interesting. I am so surprised seeing people gives high marks to this series which is much less than the movie that got a 4. I truly loved the movie, the actors played much better, the music was much better.\\n\\nSometimes, I am amazed by how viewers judge the movies or series that even had a long tenured success.\\n\\nIn this series, even the boy that plays the Avatar is not charismatic at all, I am not convinced by his playing. The only character I liked was Katara\\'s.\\n\\nThe dialogues like the spirit, it is so boring sometimes. It was so hard for me to continue watching episode by episode. I resisted only because I wanted to be able to leave a fair review and make justice to the movie. I thought it was over for any live action version of avatar when I saw the terrible 2010 movie. It was bland and left a bad taste in my mouth. But this show.. It actually has seasoning. This is avatar, at least as well as it can be portrayed as a live action.\\n\\nWe were definitely let down in the past, but let\\'s be reasonable about this show. It\\'s in my opinion unfair to judge the new remake so quickly and dismiss any new version of a live action based off of a past failure. I also know we tend to hype things up before it ever releases and set impossible expectations for the creators of the show.\\n\\nThis show deserves way more credit for how accurately it adapted to the nickelodeon cartoon we all love. If they had to remake it again, I don\\'t think there would be anything better to incorporate that this show didn\\'t already think of. They remade core episodes in the correct order and did it so graciously. This felt very similar to the cartoon. The longer you get into the story, the more you don\\'t want it to end. With the old movie, everything was rushed or even narrated.\\n\\nThe cast... I mean seriously, where did they find the real life sokka! It\\'s like he came out of the cartoon. Aang is an adorable character and the actor played the role very well. Zuko, Katara, honestly just everyone was perfectly casted. Even small background characters like the cabbage man made his comeback. The wardrobe, effects and scenery, just brilliantly done. Chef\\'s freaking kiss. This show felt like watching the old cartoon again in a fresh light. I appreciate how funny, emotional, and even terrifying this show is. It didn\\'t feel like it\\'s made just for kids, but also for the fans who grew up with it.\\n\\nI am truly excited about this show and hope we get to see more of it. I mean, the show is good enough. It doesn\\'t fail it\\'s fans, sticks to the main story line and at least tries to recreate the charm of the animated version. However, there is a reason why certain stories better translate through animation and not live action. It\\'s about the suspension of disbelief.\\n\\nMost of the characters come across more like cosplayers, look very distinct from another, each having their defining features much like animated characters would. But in real life it just looks cheap, too pretty. The characters don\\'t feel like lived characters, if that makes sense.\\n\\nThe dialogue can also be very stiff and stale. Sometimes the effects look rather cheap, but I don\\'t really mind. It is only minor things. When the big fights happen and bending is involved, the effects look really good. Also really brutal (esp. During the air temple attack and that one scene in the fire lord\\'s throne room).\\n\\nI also found most of the actors did a good job: Iroh, Zuko, Suki, Azula. I also found myself chuckle at times when Sokka had some one-liners, but overall, the acting is... meh.\\n\\nI think it is impossible to view this show apart from the animated series and the live action movie that shall not be named. Compared to the latter it is liquid gold, but next to the original series it kinda just comes across like a fan made project with a big budget.\\n\\nStill, it was respectful of the fans, shortened or combined the story beats but stuck to the main ones. It doesn\\'t disappoint, but also doesn\\'t prove why it should exist at all.\\n\\nI don\\'t want to come across as someone who hates this show. I don\\'t. But if I were to decide between rewatching this or the animated version, I will always pick the animated version. I like this show, no it isn\\'t exact to the animated series but that isn\\'t essentially a bad thing. It follows as close as possible with having a stellar look-a-like casting choice and you can tell the heart is there. Media change is probably the reason for the rushed development, they had to squeeze in the budget and time frame. Whereas on an animation you can draw what and who you like.\\n\\nI like to see this as more of a \"This is what it would look like to turn the animated series into live action\" and that\\'s what we got. The world of Avatar: The Last Airbender in stunning CGI and real people. You have to give it to the actors for really trying to resemble their animated versions, even if their dialog is a little wooden. The \\'Cabbage Guy\\' in episode 3 was more of a cameo gag but i understand why it was in there. The writers really tried to map the cartoon but it unfortunately comes with it\\'s problems. Same goes for most of the dialog from certain characters.\\n\\nMy point is, don\\'t let yourself get annoyed at the fact it isn\\'t copied (as someone said in another review) \"frame by frame\", because it would just be daft to. Media change changes all aspects, it\\'s not easy going from cartoon to live action, different rules apply. Different availabilities. Just sit back and enjoy some cool effects with still a good story. Remember this is an adaption, and it\\'s good. Much better than the movie from 2010. This series is much much worse than the 2010 movie. Netflix had 8 hours to tell the same story and it managed to screw up. I feel like the movie brought more information in only 2 hours. Without mentioning better actors, dialogue and plot. It is quite impressive how little Netflix can do with so much money. And once again the viewers will have to wait god-knows-how-many years for the continuation. Every time I watch a Netflix series I feel like I\\'m being pranked, they keep me watching without ever bringing the show to an end. Pretty disappointing. It is worth watching, it is a great story. But don\\'t buy into the 10/10 reviews, it is very very far from a 10. Its not very good but not the worst. The main issue was the dialogue felt forced and unnatural due to over exposition. This was the same problem as the 2010 movie and overall made most scenes a hard watch. Some positives would be the visuals as the costume and set design was impeccable. The world felt alive and they did a good job bringing the locations from the animated series to life. The directing and cinematography was also good however it felt very safe and was not inventive hence it did nothing out of the ordinary. Another flaw would be the pacing as it felt too rushed at times especially when getting to the north. In the animated series, the side stories helped with character development and that was lacking severely in the adaptation. I just loved this show. I had watched the anime years ago and it was cute, funny and silly, but this version is beautiful, characters have more debt and it\\'s more serious, . I absolutely love the cast, all these wonderful actors that I don\\'t know. So glad they made a point of taking actors that weren\\'t caucasian.\\n\\nAs with all movies in the fantasy field, the critics are so harsh. But as we can see from the general public, this is very well received.\\n\\nI\\'m on the 5th episode and I\\'m really hoping it keeps going and they make a second season out of this show. Really enjoying it, binging it! Keep it going!! I\\'m excited for the series and the visuals were great. The story line although some changes from the animation was much closer and more enjoyable than the movie. But its just that if there wasn\\'t the terrible movie to compare it to than this series would have been ranked lower for me. The acting and casting just missed the mark. Seemed like none of the actors were fans of the series and just learning the script for the first time. Everything seemed so robotic and all the fun and comedic feel was removed. Honestly the character choice for pretty much everyone just seemed off no one really felt like they fit the role they were playing. Which the exception of Fire Lord Ozai he was casted well. But Zuko and Azula were totally disappointing. I think of your a fan its still worth watching it will most likely be the best live action version we get but. Don\\'t get your expectations up to high. I am a HUGE fan of the animated show. I have watched the series several times and so I was hesitant to watch a live action of a show I\\'ve loved so much. This being said , I saw a lot of negativity about casting and costumes and etc and really didn\\'t want something I\\'ve loved so much to be poorly done again.\\n\\nI am SO happy I didn\\'t listen to the negativity. I am so impressed with the show and I\\'m happy to see a show I\\'ve spent most of my life loving so beautifully executed. There are so many things they kept true to the animated series and the creative liberty they have taken does not go against the original content. I am actually pleased with the casting and love the Inuit representation.\\n\\nI cannot wait to see the other seasons of this show. We can now do what used to only be able to be done in cartoons. This is okay, but it\\'s a long way from the show we fell in love with decades ago. The cast tries and if we hadn\\'t seen ATLA & KORRA it would be okay. But the humor is absent, in addition to the whole thing just being chaotic and frenetic and disorganized. Skimming the best bits from a few episodes and trying to make the whole thing work just makes nothing work.\\n\\nOn the positive side, I believe Mako is smiling and nodding in approval at Paul Sun-Hyung Lee\\'s performance.\\n\\nBy and large the show is just another lackluster, ho hum reimagining. They\\'ve changed many little things for no reason at all, Sokka has no soul, no jokes, no comments, no life. Who is the avatar? Katara or Aang? Cause she does literally everything, which makes no sense at all, this series should be named Avatar, the legend of katara. They made her stronger than aang and this makes no sense at all.\\n\\nWhat can we say if literally every single show made in those years are like that, the main character if it is a man, it\\'s weak, can\\'t do anything, it\\'s a useless piece of flesh, but every single woman is THE SUPA STRONGA, dude, really, netflix should just close their doors and never touch anything again. I had my expectations low and it shattered them. This live action doesn\\'t disappoint and the characters I fell in love with in the anime version of the show are full of life. I like that they kept the foundation and made interesting changes. Netflix in my eyes continues to deliver. The special effects are so realistic they definitely blew my mind. The story writing is fun definitely creative. This Ang doesn\\'t hold back the show he enhanced the character and brought new life to the world of avatar. I\\'ve waited for a faithful adaptation and the live action that hit as hard as the original show and this without doubt is such a fun ride. I couldn\\'t understand what most of the leading children were saying. Every line was delivered at a rapid clipped pace. Katara, aang, even kyoshi... Blurred dialogue delivery made the whole thing feel very amateurish. I needed subtitles to understand most of what was being said. Strangely, the subtitles added spaces between words that the actors did not provide. Lots of cringe. Zero fun. Also, I sat through 2 hours of this and didn\\'t even chuckle once. Every element was rushed, the humor of the original was removed, and this live-action\\'s reliance on amateurish live actors was a poor choice, given the talent of the chosen actors. The makeup looks amateurish, the physics of bending lack power, and the character development is a shadow of the orginal series. It takes itself too seriously and not seriously enough at the wrong times.\\n\\nA better effort than the Shamalan adaptation and at time enjoyable but it fails to capture the soul that made you fall in love with the characters. Some of the new additions are welcome and the need to mesh storylines is understandable but the series tries to bring themes that are developed over three seasons of ATLA to the forefront too early and Aang\\'s character arch is not mature enough to handle it yet. Many positive reviews mention fans of the animation series having unrealistic shot for shot expectations as if that\\'s the reason for so many poor reviews. This misses the mark entirely.\\n\\nThe biggest issue holding the live action back is the frenetic pacing and exposition, combined with weak main character performances, specifically the Aang and Katara actors. The animation was able to bring to life multifaceted and flawed characters who grow in various ways throughout the series. The live action completely misses the mark here. Aang is solemn and melodramatic, completely lacking joy and fun. Katara is meek and feeble without ANY emotion. The writing is much to blame. The relentless plot advancement and tendency to \"tell\" instead of \"show\" doesn\\'t help. But even so, these actors don\\'t seem able to able to act the required range anyways.\\n\\nOg fans love the animated series because of the incredible character development. With that missing, it\\'s simply impossible to get emotionally invested in what\\'s portrayed. Visuals and CGI is great for the most part. If you are a fan of spectacle than I can see you enjoying this show. However, if you\\'re looking for more than beautiful sets and fight scenes you will be sorely disappointed.\\n\\nIt\\'s clear everyone involved deeply loved the source material and their effort is commendable. I do hope the series is renewed for another couple seasons. That said, Season 2 would benefit from slowing down the plot advancement pace by only tackling half the animated series book 2 with focus on giving longer dialogue scenes where we can become more emotionally invested in the characters. I literally do not understand why people are being so critical. First off the casting is *chefs kiss* particularly sokka, iroh and bumi. The negative reviews are people who wanted this to be a word for word remake of the original. It was never going to be that. I mean it\\'s pretty dang close to the og, like episode for episode. Including all major side characters!!! Yessss some stuff gets cut out but likeeeee it\\'s fine. The best live action remake I\\'ve ever seen for sure. I was very hesitant to like this bc ATLA is very precious to so many but it\\'s perfect to me. A fresh take on a childhood classic. As someone who grew up with ATLA, being in the prime demographic as it originally aired, it has always been one of my favorite pieces of media. The heart, philosophy, and humor are simply too special to ever match, as evidenced by the sequel series. But I did not go into this LA iteration with the ridiculous expectation of seeing a shot for shot remake of the original. Rather, this series finally delivered on what I have dreamed of for almost 20 years, a faithful, more mature, and ultimately fun adaptation for a beloved fantasy series delivered by a cast and crew that clearly hold as much respect and love for the series as the fans. I had to give this a 10, simply because it deserves more than what many reviewers are giving it. The minor changes make sense, and if people are down scoring it because it\\'s not the exact script from the cartoon, then they\\'re delusional. The writers got rid of some side quests, fleshed out the characters a bit more, and added grit. I absolutely love the portrayals of the cast. Aang is top-notch. Sokka is brilliant. Katara is great. Zuko is wonderful. And Iroh, who is my favorite character in the animated series, gets better and better as each episode progresses. And to the people who say this was worse than Shymalan\\'s.....you\\'ve gotta be kidding me. There is no reason to compare this to that terrible movie. The comparison should only be made to the original animated series, which is a work of art.\\n\\nThe new series misses everything that fans loved about the original series. It replaces it with a visual and unnecessary depiction of dark themes (to supposedly appear mature), and with endless, emotionless expository text. In the Netflix series, we are exposed to superficial characters who only reflect the stigma attached to the original character (and even here, the writers failed), and nothing beyond. The dialogue is thin and boring, the exposition is endless, emotionless, and logically flawed. In the original Avatar, every character had depth, emotion, logic, and comedy. Every character has a role, but they are not defined by that role alone. The characters are human. Throughout the original series, the characters develop and mature. The viewers are exposed to wonderfully written backstories, understanding their personalities. We see this through an excellent presentation of the story, not just a narrative text. In the original Avatar, there is development as a team (Team Avatar). In Netflix, each character lives in their own world! There\\'s no camaraderie, just a superficial connection between the characters, there\\'s nothing there! Sokka and Katara join Aang \"because they can\\'t go back home\" suddenly-??\\n\\nIn the original series, we have two full episodes (the first ones) that show the initial connection between the heroes, the conflict arising if Katara and Sokka leave home, and their commitment to save Aang after he sacrificed himself to protect their village. Only then does their grandmother realize their destiny to help the Avatar.\\n\\nNetflix lacks all of this. Katara and Sokka go to rescue Aang without explanation. Before all of that the grandmother somehow discovers Aang is the Avatar, and it adds nothing to the story depth. No one even acknowledges her. At best, this is lazy writing; at worst, it\\'s contempt for the viewer.\\n\\nAnd that\\'s just the first 5 minutes of the show, the rest is much worse.\\n\\n(I\\'m not comparing it to the depth of the story, so you won\\'t have spoilers, for the animated series of course)\\n\\nIn the Netflix series, they decided to take all the episodes, stories, and plot of season 1 (and even some of season 2, for some reason) of the original and turn them into a rotten vegetable salad. Nothing connects, unrelated things suddenly linked without logical reason. Everything is ruined. The result is that every character (remember, they were already given no chance by the writers to bond as a group) goes on a boring journey of their own, ending in especially childish and bland development, just so Netflix\\'s distorted plot could eventually resolve. It feels as if ChatGPT wrote the series based on ideas from the original.\\n\\nAll this before even discussing the cringeworthy acting (especially Katara, a terrible actress with strange and hesitant expressions), the generic Hollywood music (the original series had a unique, unforgettable soundtrack), and the shallow plot compared to the original.\\n\\nHowever, it seems that the actors (except for Katara and Uncle Iroh with childish acting) do try to do some justice to the show, but they received poor text with confusing directions about the emotions of the characters. Or they might not have had enough time to learn the scenes.\\n\\nThe actors mostly do look like the animated originals.\\n\\nThe casting is not bad; the execution is poor!\\n\\nThe graphics are amazing, but the bending (element manipulation) should have been faster. Watch the trailer at 1.5 speed to see how it\\'s supposed to be. (Or just watch the original!)\\n\\nAnyone who watches the new Avatar on Netflix without knowing the original Avatar will think it\\'s a good series. They might rate it between 5 and 7 if they\\'re really generous (and even that\\'s only for the graphics) and move on with their life.\\n\\nBut if you want a mature series, well-written, with depth, emotion, originality, and logic, a series that will touch your heart, watch the animated Avatar series of Nickelodeon.\\n\\nFor the Netflix Avatar: 3.5/10, just for the graphics and the attempt to bring an amazing and beloved story to life. I don\\'t understand the low reviews. The live-action only fails on not being the original, which it could not accomplish.\\n\\nThe special effects, the casting, the humor and action, the characters so perfectly coming to life, and the plot so beautiful executed by all involved.\\n\\nI don\\'t think it could have been much better. There\\'re some episodes that are lower paced and more quirky, but they follow the original and sometime add to it with the visuals and more.\\n\\nPlease, let us fans get the rest of the saga!\\n\\nThe series only improves with each season! I need to see Zuko\\'s redemption, Katara\\'s mastery of the forbidden art, and the little Earth Bender we are still missing from Team Avatar.\\n\\nAang!!! We need more Aang, and Sokka, and Suki, and Iroh... even Azula, and her yet to be better met two friends 😃 It was ten times better than the previous hot pile of garbage, but the writing could have been better.\\n\\nI feel the writers tried including what they deemed the \"key\" elements of ATLA, but they missed sight of crucial character and plot development that was subtle in the original production.\\n\\nI wasn\\'t confused for someone who has watched the original series and knows the lore, but for someone who hasn\\'t watched the original series, they\\'d be super confused. Things like how Katara\\'s bending drastically improved, Aang and the Avatar gang\\'s relationships, and Zuko and his dilemma between capturing the Avatar and wanting to please his father are all essential arcs in the original production that tied together to make an excellent series. I\\'m assuming the directors were given a time limit for the entire season and, hence, had to cut off parts, but this is where I feel they missed.\\n\\nThey cut off parts from the original series at the cost of the characters\\' overall development and plot.\\n\\nSpecial effects and bending were out of this world. The music and editing were excellent. I\\'d give it between a 3.7 and 4 out of 5. It wasn\\'t a remake that made my jaw drop, but it was a job well done. I\\'m not quite sure if I at first should apologize. The original series is one of my all time favorites concerning animation series, what means it is hard for me not to be without bias.\\n\\nPutting this aside I really tried to be open minded watching this series, but: I DON\\'T LIKE IT.\\n\\nFirst, as many others said, it completely lacks of humor. It takes itself much to serious but still wants to be as close to the original as possible. IMHO this alone is one of the biggest problems.\\n\\nSecondly the writing is very poor. Why would you change a successful story arc? Why give away every detail, that\\'s meant to be revealed during the plot, in the first episode? Ok, when you know the original, you know what will come, but if anybody really likes this series, it\\'s someone who does not know the original.\\n\\nSeriously: watch the original. It\\'s still absolutely great and available in High Definition. It has more heart und is way more funny.\\n\\nAnd to Netflix, Disney and Co.: are you that much out of ideas? Stop touching timeless classics! Absolutely Excellent It\\'s probably an 8.5 but I\\'m giving it ten to counter the people who decided they wouldn\\'t like it before watching it .\\n\\nThe acting is great . Obviously episode 1 is a bit clumsy but by episode 5 it\\'s improved out of sight and everyone is stepping into their roles and characters\\n\\nThe effects are excellent. The Bending looks great It\\'s balanced the dark with the jovial well.\\n\\nFor the ridiculous haters of course it\\'s not the anime It\\'s telling a story of humanity aswell dark and bright. Not the goofy anime characters .YOU EXPECT that of live action adaptions\\n\\nThe story telling is great . It sticks to the story .. approximately and that\\'s good we wouldn\\'t want it to deviate mich but also we don\\'t want it to be an exact copy of the anime .. people who complain about that .. stick to watching dragonballz\\n\\nI sincerely hope this is taken to completion by Netflix it would be a serious shame it the story is not finished in this series .\\n\\nThen hopefully a live action adaptions of Kora would follow . While I think this has great potential, I would like for some of the characters especially katara to feel more real. It\\'s almost as if the actress is having a hard time believing she\\'s playing the role of katara and won\\'t fully divulge into who she\\'s playing. I think a couple more classes will really help season two feel real and authentic. I like the duo between aang and sokka.\\n\\nI genuinely believe the show did a good job at setting the scenes right and most of the characters are actinggggg. Zuko was actually a great cast because I feel like he has the attitude of zuko down. Would like to see the following seasons taken more seriously especially from the actress who plays katara. Feels too silly for her. Amazing storytelling, this might be different from the animation in quite a few ways but it still feels like ATLA, the visuals, the phenomenal bending, the amazing action scenes, the surroundings, the costumes, the worldbuilding, the creature designs and not to mention the phenomenal soundtracks courtesy of Takeshi Furukawa and his amazing team. Sure there were some iffy moments, like the constant exposition in episode 1 but I made it pass due to the fact that I knew that was for new viewers who haven\\'t seen the Original series before which was always going to be needed and was always going to be annoying to those who already knew the story but that\\'s okay and there were also some scenes to nitpick but not enough to take me out of the story 9.5/10. I didn\\'t quite understand the logic behind mixing everything together in this new version. What made the original series special was carefully crafting how the characters evolve and revealing why they are the persons now. Hints are spread through seasons for all main characters creating a strong bond with the viewer.\\n\\nIf the aim was making the show shorter, just leaving some parts out could be a better solution instead of just throwing everything in a confused mix.\\n\\nI wish they made a series for a past or future avatar with all this budget and cast instead of a remake. I would prefer watching Kiyoshi or Roku perspective to the story. Right off the bat, the show is not horrible. It\\'s not unwatchable. It is, in fact, MILES better than the live action movie from 2010. BUT almost everything about it is easily worse than the original cartoon.\\n\\nWithout any spoilers, the story is changed heavily. All of a sudden, the reasons why some events happen don\\'t make sense and don\\'t achieve the same character moments as they did in the cartoon. Stuff is condensed so much in places that the story doesn\\'t have any room to breathe, while also adding new scenes and plot points. All of the characters, for the most part, including Aang, are extremely poorly written. The dialogue is generic. Everyone is just an exposition dump machine. Honestly, why would the show creators ever think this is a compelling way to do character development?\\n\\nThere are a ton of complaints I can list here, but honestly, the fact that the original show creators ran away from this project during the pre-production stage should tell all of you what is going on... It is really a shame. I hope they end up making a live action version that is deserving of the original some day, not a cheap, soulless retelling of it. People are only saying bad things about it, because it\\'s \"cool\" to rag on things. The same people that are like \"I only watch subbed anime, never dub. Only true anime fans watch sub only\" It really wasn\\'t bad. People just like to s*** on things. Just watch it and make your own opinion. Remember it will be different at times. If you wanted to watch the exact same show then watch the animated version. Some of the differences they made are because the actors will age by season 2&3 and so they have to write the story accordingly. This is live-action, actors age. Again watch the animated version if you want the exact same show. That\\'s what it\\'s there for. People are so weird getting all upset over this. I had to re-evaluate the series after watching it for the second time. The series is AMAZING! It\\'s really good and now it\\'s my favorite live action series, surpassing One Piece! All the questions I raised the first time were due to not paying attention to details, but the series is well resolved and with just one \"flaw\" Aang doesn\\'t bend water this season, however you might think that The Book of a certain element It is the phase where Aang learns how to bend a certain element or you can think of it as the book where Aang finds his master of a certain element. In this book of Water Aang found his self-taught master and she will be Katara, who proved to be a rare bender of the water element. It was clear to Pakko that her bending was not inferior to his, she just had no combat experience. Yes, Katara is like that in the cartoon! Don\\'t forget that in the cartoon she learned the rarest bend in her tribe just by hearing it and seeing it, that was enough for her to bend blood! While mastering the technique took years.\\n\\nI also think Aang should have waterbended, but he refused at first when Katara wanted to train him, but he now has the water master with him and will continue training. Like many fans of the original show probably, I was looking forward to this show with cautious optimism. It had the potential to be great, but we had been burned before.\\n\\nAnd after watching the show I must say I\\'m slightly disappointed. It\\'s not a bad show per se, the visuals are great and the story follows the main plot more or less. But there are a lot of changes that while they themselves are minor, due to there being so many collectively they do change the tone and story a lot.\\n\\nI won\\'t go into details to avoid spoilers, but a lot of these changes seemed unnecessary and felt like they were made just to change things from the original and not because they served a purpose. Or to include as much as possible from a 20+ episode cartoon into an 8 episode live action show. I appreciate the intent, but mixing storylines or giving them to other characters doesn\\'t always work and I wish they would have left some things out, instead of forcing them in there.\\n\\nOverall it\\'s not a bad show, but it leaves a certain bad aftertaste in my mouth. I\\'m giving it a 6.5/10. I watched with friends and we really enjoyed it! Bunch of different levels of avatar fandom in our group, as for me, I watched the original several times. A lot of solid aspects to this version (coreagraphy, maintenance of the heart of the story, etc). Definitely a bit of clunkiness with dialogue and acting, but overall still fun to watch. It is apparent that a lot of heart went into it. Really, don\\'t let other people influence your judgement before you give it a chance. It seems that people are posting extreme polars for ulterior motives (e.g., fishing for views/controversy or political ideology). Wish that people just learned to take themselves less seriously. Look is the show as good as the original? God no. But it\\'s still good, just don\\'t compare. They\\'re trying something different and they\\'re doing it well, they\\'re giving side characters like lieutenant Jee and the earth bender who was in charge of transporting iroh more context which is something the og show never did. Is there bad? Yes but when is there a perfect show right off the bat. Just look at the show with the eyes of \"hey this show looks nice it\\'s about a world where people can control elements and one kid can control all 4\" that\\'s it. If you keep comparing a show to a show that\\'s 10/10 everything will look ass in comparison. So just look at it with fresh eyes. Zuko and irohs relationship is really good in this show as well. I loved the cartoon and I loved this adaptation. I see them as seperate. I mean they have made this world come to live in a more mature and action filled way.\\n\\nThey have chosen to change the order and some details, but at the core the important moments and charactistics are there. The atmosphere is thrilling and moving. The outfits are great and so is the set design. The story feels a bit rushed but it wasn\\'t a dealbreaker for me.\\n\\nThe humor of the characters is still there but of course less, but I understand that it is much easier to incorporate exaggarating facial expressions and comical moments in a cartoon than in this adaptation.\\n\\nI do feel like they should have focused more on the childish innocent side of aang rather than rushing him to be a mature protagonist. Agree with some reviews and don\\'t agree with some. Any adaptation of this nature is difficult and this is not the best by far but definitely good and decent. Strangely I got connected to the antagonists more than protagonist performance, probably due to the script or character selection. But Zuko and Iroh has done great deal of justice, the way they play through emotions for every flashback is enthralling for a fantasy series. I can\\'t find fault with fire lord ozai himself or other antagonist roles. Having said that the protagonists definitely grow on you as the series progresses. Please watch few episodes before making your judgment. It deserves least one sit through and definitely entertaining. I have not seen the cartoon, and from what I hear there are creative differences from the cartoon and the show and that is the main cause of the negative reviews. Which is a shame because I do not believe it deserves it.\\n\\nFrom my point of view this show is extremely impressive. It is like watching a AAA film every episode. This is done better than a lot of 200 million dollar Marvel movies, it puts what Disney makes to shame. The production quality of this show is the best I have ever seen in any TV show. The story is good (8/10), the choreography and how they use bending power is fantastic (10/10), world building is fantastic(10/10). They have massive fantasy cities and large scales wars at the fraction of the budget of the rings of power. The battle scenes in this show put the battles in the wheel of time and rings of power to shame, which should ask the question what are the other studios doing with their budget??\\n\\nOverall, this show is very very good, if you are interested in a fantasy show I would definitely recommend this. Coming into this show without having seen the original cartoon, I found myself captivated by the amazing visuals and action sequences. The special effects are truly top-notch, constantly delivering eye-catching moments that kept me engaged throughout. It\\'s a feast for the eyes!\\n\\nHowever, there were some aspects that left me wanting more. The characters, while visually interesting, didn\\'t have the same depth and connection that I think they should have.\\n\\nPacing was also a bit of a rollercoaster. Some parts in the middle felt like they dragged on, slowing down the overall momentum. On the other hand, some scenes, particularly towards the end, felt rushed, leaving me wanting more development and emotional payoff.\\n\\nWhile I appreciate the potential for further exploration, I think the show would have benefitted from a more conclusive finale that didn\\'t blatantly set up a sequel. It could have provided a stronger overall impact with a more definitive wrapping up of the story arc.\\n\\nOverall, for someone completely new to the Avatar universe, \"The Last Airbender\" offered some stunning visuals and exciting action. However, the lack of character depth and the uneven pacing held it back from reaching its full potential. I can see why fans of the original cartoon might be disappointed, but for newcomers like myself, it was a decent, visually impressive adventure with room for improvement. I felt nothing watching this show. This show missing its core element and that is its character\\'s depth. The original show is famous for character development arcs like Sokka in Kyoshi Island for example. They changed so much story and it looks all over the place.\\n\\nOn the other hand One Piece live-action is successful because though they changed some stories, they were able to draw out their character\\'s depth. By doing so they became the first successful anime live adaptation show.\\n\\nThe positive about this show is its visual and bending sequence. It looks pretty cool in live-action. I\\'m glad they used soundtracks from the original show.\\n\\nSo overall this show is below average and I hope they correct those mistakes if they make 2nd season. I hope they make an enjoyable 2nd season. All the bad reviews are by the toxic cult gate keeping the animated series. I\\'ve watched the anime and I understand it\\'s unmatchably great. But this live action adaptation is so true to the animation, they did a really great job man. All the cast are amazing (except Katara for me).\\n\\nObviously for live action medium, they needed to crisp it up, so certain plot points are trimmed, but that\\'s ok. It doesn\\'t feel rushed or anything.\\n\\nThis adaptation is a solid 8-8.5/10. But I\\'m giving it a 10 to balance the bad ratings given by the toxic nay sayers.\\n\\nBe wise guys, don\\'t let Netflix cancel this one. You will never get a better live action adaptation better than this. I hardly ever write reviews unless I just see an influx of ridiculous negative comments. My wife and I binge watched the whole thing in one night. We could not stop. The amount of people who complained about no humor i don\\'t get it. For people who say it went to serious...are you kidding? If you look at the actual plot it\\'s about inserting children\\'s into a long and bloody war, of course live action is going to look and feel more intense. All I know is this series seriously deserves more credit where credit is due especially with all the terrible movies and series that have been coming out in the last 2 years. TEAM AVATAR! Can\\'t wait got season 2. First off I\\'ve seen a lot of stuff comparing the humor not being there. For one it\\'s not an animated series directed towards children. The show has humor just not over the top animated humor. I think the humor is perfect for a live action Show. Imagine it just being goofy like the animated, it wouldn\\'t be much of a new show. The do a great job keeping the show as original as they can without just copying the animated Series. I feel like the characters are pretty spot on with the acting. One of the best live action remakes in awhile. Living to the hype like one piece live action. Give me hope for other live action shows. First, the positives: visually stunning and mostly true to the source material. While they did rework some of the stories from the animated series, this was usually well done and I am happy with the changes. The bending is visually appealing and the set locations are stunning.\\n\\nThen the negatives: the dialogue consists of cringy \"deep and meaningful\" conversations sprinkled with the occasional quip. The director definitely went the way of a tell don\\'t show approach to character development that was tired and plain annoying by the end. Let\\'s not get started about the acting.\\n\\nThat all said, I hope that they continue with season 2 and work to improve the show. The groundwork is there, all they need to do is build better. This show is a mess. They absolutely butchered every single character they all feel so flat. The actors, writing, story, and some of the visuals need soo much improvement it\\'s not even funny. I understand that they can\\'t adapt this show exactly the same but this version has lost all the soul of the original. The only thing going for it is some of the fight scenes that are done very well.\\n\\nBtw the actress who plays katara might be one of the worse actors I\\'ve ever seen. 0 emotion I would be able to act better.\\n\\nThe only good scenes are the ones that are a copy straight out of the cartoon.\\n\\nDon\\'t waste ur time with this. As usual Netflix destroys a beloved show just for some revenue. It is difficult to adapt a beloved show. If the original is really great, in a sense, the adaptation can only be worse.\\n\\nThis adaptation is miles above the movie that-shall-not-be-named, but it still disappointed many fans. I understand that. Some of it is just nostalgia. The avatar animated show was amazing, but season 2 and 3 are when it really took off. Season 1 was good, with great moments, but not yet a masterpiece. So a lot of expectations were too high and probably unreachable.\\n\\nAt the same time, comparisons are unavoidable. The show was allowed to make changes: take a different tone, change the episode format, etc... But knowing the great source material that was available in the animated, some choices are still baffling.\\n\\nOverall, the show did many things really well. The visuals, first, were amazing, with few exceptions. From the sets and costumes to CGI landscapes and bending, it was really both beautiful and faithful to the world. The action was often good or great. Most importantly, it had its heart in the right place.\\n\\nThe issues start to appear in the plot. This show tried to keep many story beats from the original, but in only 8 episodes, that meant mashing together many plotlines together. This more often than not failed, rushing through too many things at once. The show was at its best when it let one a single plotline breath into a full episode. If future seasons are adapted, I hope they dare to cut more (or even better increase the episode count, even if this means higher budget).\\n\\nThe constant rush is probably part of the reason we never get to really enjoy the Gaang, either individually or as a group. We see too little of their dynamic, as they are often split apart to follow different plotlines. And individually, we simply have too little of them being them, instead focusing on them doing things to move along the dense plot. Their flaws are mostly removed, reducing their space to grow. Their personality is more often that not explained instead of being shown. Hearing \"I like goofing off\" does not quite give the same effect as actually seeing a character goofing off. Zuko and Iroh are the only ones to really get meaningful character moments. Since characters were arguably the strongest point of the original, it is sad to see this.\\n\\nAt the end, is it a pleasant show? Yes, I think so. But I don\\'t think the quality was here to bring new viewers to think \"this was a masterpiece\". For me, it is a solid 8. Once I removed my expectations, I enjoyed the show, and some episodes, episode 6 in particular, really gave me high hopes for the future.\\n\\nIf netflix greenlights more seasons, which I really hope, I think the potential is there. If the writers can learn from this season, give more time for our characters to shine, start showing instead of telling, and otherwise keep the visual quality and the obvious care they had for the show, I think we COULD have a masterpiece. The momentum with original music is sometimes inadequate.\\n\\n\\nThere is a lack of chemistry between main actors.\\n\\n\\nThe show must use with parcimony, or no use at all, the litteral citations of original and elements from next seasons.\\n\\n\\nPast Avatars were dark and mean. Big lack of kindness, compassion and solemnity. Fierce doesn\\'t equal mean and agressive for Kyoshi. Kuruk is disturbed, not helpful. Roku is not supposed to look like a 90s character half funny half relevant. His wisdom, his greatness are very important in the original. Completely messed up by Netflix.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBUT... Avatar: The Last Airbender is a tv series full of love for the original material and it appears clearly. There are many changes compared from the animated series, but all of these are for good and well introduced in the show. The most beautiful thing of the animated series are characters and how they are pictured. In this live action adaptation, every main character is interesting and well showed. In general, the product is very good, the trio Aang, Sokka and Katara works well and many things are well settled for the next seasons. Overall, An excellent remake of the original and the VFX was insanely good. I couldn\\'t make it through the first episode because the voices all sound like a terrible dub. What is going on? If you are going to dub over actors who are literally speaking the lines on camera, it needs to be done FLAWLESSLY. Though I\\'m not even sure that this is dubbed? The voices and levels on the voices of the characters just sounds super bizarre and unnatural. It\\'s literally so bad that the show is unwatchable. How did this get the green light? Am I taking crazy pills or does it sound like the actors are speaking from inside a low budget sound booth? I\\'m padding this review for length, sorry. I feel disappointed with so much mix and match of events. Every story in avatar is worth telling, and doesn\\'t deserve to be tangled with other events to shorten them. Even The Great Divide is worth telling. They skipped so much. I mean, where is Jeong Jeong? The comedic element is almost negligible.\\n\\nI think it\\'s very fast paced. And there are some major restructuring of storytelling which is achieved by taking shortcuts. It\\'s like movie version of a detailed book. You lose so much in a movie but if you read the original book, you find so much more depth to every story. I can see why the original creators of the avatar universe parted ways from this project. They did make some changes to the story too. The fandom probably won\\'t like those changes. Not major changes but ATLA fandom is very religious about the show. Like, penguin sledding is quite a significant event in a hindsight.\\n\\nThere won\\'t be many surprises or plot twists for you if you watch the animated series after you watch the live action series. Actually same can be said about the live action series but the level of detail you get in the animated series makes it worth watching it first.\\n\\nActing is good for the most part. Visuals are great! Casting could have been better.\\n\\nAs a standalone series, this would have been rated a lot higher. So, there is surely a bias when reviewing this series, not just from me, but from the whole fandom. And I would say, rightfully so. We know what it could\\'ve been if done correctly. It only reflects how amazing this story and universe is, even when the whole story isn\\'t told correctly, if that makes sense. As Zuko often says, all hope is lost (for future seasons). Will the real uncle Iroh please stand up? Now first and foremost, I have never watched the \\'cartoon/anime\" series, so this may put me at a disadvantage by some, however, in my defence, it gives me a perspective away from what those that know... The young actors in this series are somewhat wooden and are less engaging with the audience, the dialogue is somewhat delivered without conviction or emotion, however, the storylines resonate throughout, without preaching to the converted or any preconceived ideas.\\n\\nEach episode presents a issue/problem that is surpassed by simple human logic and emotional growth, showing the audience that any obstacle can be overcome by interacting with friends and colleagues on a human level and even understanding the \\'enemy\\' with empathic thoughts.\\n\\nThoroughly enjoyed... this should be seen by parents and children with a discussion emphasizing the joys of friendships overcoming adversity. [+30%) They got us with the CGI, man. The graphics were dark, gritty, and complete. You could believe in bending now. I watched the series and went back to watch the OG animation - sorry to say this - The animation felt inferior!\\n\\n[+20%] Our favorite non-human characters from the animation on-screen live-action is a nostalgic experience. If you are a fan, you know the story. You await the characters and you rejoice in the appearance. You. Feel. Good. All credit to the CGI team.\\n\\n[+10%] Thanks to the makers for not having cut down the major sequences of Avatar, which makes Avatar, the Avatar. You get to completely enjoy the climax, frame by frame. No disappointment there. I don\\'t want to nitpick either.\\n\\n[±10%] The casting is not perfect but better than Avatar (2010). The actors do resemble their animated counterparts. You love some. You hate some. Subjective.\\n\\n[-10%] You could search for music during epic moments. The sound design should have been better, and epic moments needed epic BG music which was not the case in this series, unfortunately.\\n\\n[-10%] I don\\'t know what kept them from making this a 13-part series, most probably budget. Yet, it means, that they have to cramp the storylines and alter story tracks which did not sit well with me.\\n\\n[-20%] Humor, a strong forte of the OG animation went practically non-existent in this 8-part series. Huge letdown, especially to Sokka\\'s character. Everyone is so serious, it sucks.\\n\\nScore: [+20%]\\n\\nAvatar: The Last Airbender Live-Action series by Netflix and Nickelodeon is a dream attempt to revive the original phenomenon which is evident from the incredible production quality they show us on screens but constraints still exist, limiting the complete scope of the revitalization, especially in terms of story and screenplay - factors which cannot be compromised resulting in an average output as a whole but still a memorable and impressionable one at that.\\n\\nVetrrich Chelvan, NETFLIX22240224. Test obviously it\\'s going to miss an element or two BUT it literally tells the story in a great way and has the core of all the critical points to it. Visually good and the acting is an 7/10. But no way a show like this would have a 10/10 for what it is. If you saw this show first before ever having seen the original animation, you would have loved this show. So on that premise... it\\'s a 10/10. Dont be so quick to nit pick. Loved this so far for what it is. The action was awesome!!! And the animation for the bending was way better than expected as well. When it comes to adapting an \"anime\" type show, how can you expect any better than this. Loved this show... period. Now it\\'s obviously not going to be like the original. What\\'s the point of copying it word for word? That being said, some changes were nice and others weren\\'t.\\n\\nThey did take away a lot of the humor and character the main cast had. This was for an obvious reason, the people watching the live action version are now likely young adults and so the theme would be darker. Humor comes from the artstyle too, which wasn\\'t possible with live action.\\n\\nBut the characters and their personalities have been muted down significantly. That didn\\'t have to be done. Now it feels super bland.\\n\\nAnyways, pretty nice. Beautiful sets and effects, most actors are pretty good at their roles, especially Zuko.\\n\\nThis was definitely better than the first live action adaptation, and it was pretty satisfactory in my opinion. I wish they hadn\\'t removed so many flaws that the characters that had made them relatable though. If you have not seen the animated series, you clearly feel something is wrong with the way story is going on. It looks too much straight, leaves no room for curiosity and thinking. No twists and no big events. Yes, big events happen but the audience may not feel them that way. That is because the characters are played badly and music is terrible. I mean at the end of the season one, in one of the most epic scenes there is no music and feels like some ordinary accident is going on. The cast is terrible as well. I mean it seems like they have been forced to make it with those actresses and actors. Especially the actress playing princess of the fire nation is unbelievably awful in every aspect. The avatar is next and then with a little distance come others like Zuko and The Uncle. These bad feedbacks get amplified if you have seen the original animated series. The funny moments of Avatar as a sweet child, the complex Character of the Uncle Iroh, and the wicked but bright and proud princes Azula. Even minor Characters are quite terrible. The only good casts in the show are Commander Zhao and Gyatso.\\n\\nOverall, there is only some good computer work and cinematography. I hope they totally recast the series and focus on the writing more than CGI for next season. Otherwise, this is already a failure.\\n\\nThese for stars are for the story itself which is still quite interesting even that it has been told badly. A great way to adapt a series that is the absolute GOAT. Some changes are weird and some feel super natural. It takes quite a few creative liberties in regards to the original but in my opinion that only ads to the show. I was worried in the beginning that they would either stray far from the original or just make a carbon copy and ij both cases I would have asked: what is the point of this show. But they really surprised me. They changed juet enough to make it super fresh and not too much so that we still recognise it as an adaptation. I really don\\'t care what people thinking about this , but I absolutely loved it ! Bravo ! Although seemingly a high review for a show with more negatives than positives, I feel pretty comfortable rating season 1 with a 7.\\n\\nI can\\'t exactly pinpoint any redeeming features aside from nostalgia towards the original animated series and huge and drawn out excitement over this shows release (which wasn\\'t entirely 100% sabotaged, like some other live actions).\\n\\nTo start with I will go over what I did like about the show.. It was fairly accurate to its original content, by that I mean they didn\\'t totally change or re-write things that have happened. What I actually immediately and much more frequently noticed was content being missing, rather than being inaccurate or revisionist. This is an overall plus to me, because one of the worst offenses (in my perspective) when creating a live action show based on cartoons, is when writers start changing things. It\\'s offensive to the original creator and also egotistical to think they know better. This show wasn\\'t so much a victim of that, not nearly as much as others. I felt it was true to the original - just not comprehensive or whole.\\n\\nNow for the bad..\\n\\nThe actors, or characters were ALL very bland, dry, and didn\\'t really portray their cartoon equivalent very well at all. The closest character I felt to the original was probably Bumi who played a relatively small and undercut role. More on this later but Bumi entire story was cut short and parts are missing (unless are yet to come, in which case would be out of chronological order). It felt to me as though they made these characters more appealing to kids (or too PG) by removing any sense of identity and likeability. I can\\'t really nail down the specific reasoning, but I just get the feeling by making these characters more kid friendly they took away any sense of identity and personality. This was specifically an issue with Aang, but also noticable with others such as Katara and Sokka. You get the sense of the characters Katara and Sakka are meant to be portraying (such as Kataras bossiness or Sakka\\'s silliness), but they don\\'t really get the desire effect. It\\'s half hearted at best. After watching the entire series I still can\\'t decide exactly say if this is a writing problem, directing problem or a casting problem..\\n\\nWithout any spoilers I will just say that whole storylines from the original are removed or heavily condensed from this series, I guess in order to make a more coherent storyline given the limited timeframe of episodes and trying to reach a certain point in the story by the end of the season. I personally think this along with the dry acting were the two biggest downfalls of the show.\\n\\nIt felt as if they tried to cover way too much of the Avatar storyline in too few episodes of this new show. It\\'s like as if they wanted to get as much out there in the chance that they won\\'t be able to make it any further (the show not being renewed). I don\\'t really understand the point of this. It pretty much ruined the storytelling and character arcs up until this point. Not seeing certain arcs completely changes the way you see different characters or the way you feel about them. They also come off as \\'less real\\' if possible, considering they are all fictional characters. More interestingly they waste time showing life for Aang before being frozen, which was never featured in the original. One place where scenes definitely could have been cut for more integral storylines that were cut.\\n\\nI think the show would have been better both in its current state, and in the future if they just took things more slowly. I think that season 1 should have ended somewhere around the time the southern water tribe was attacked, prior to the whole adventure even unfolding. For context - that was the end of episode 1. So realistically they covered what I think should have been an entire season in just one episode.. Why? Was it because they thought the show wouldn\\'t make it to the end of the story otherwise? What other possible reason could they have? And wouldn\\'t slowing things down given more job stability in the future? In other words, the longer they could have drawn the series out the more work they have for longer..\\n\\nIt\\'s not just that things happen too fast. The problem lies in that whole storylines are condensed, removed and basically ruined. One part where this was extremely evident to me was the compacting of the story of the \\'blue spirit\\'. In the cartoon there are several interactions before Aang finds out who it really is. In the live action he finds out way too soon which ruins the entire plot of that arc. There are several other instances of the same thing, basically every arc with some being worse offenders than others such as the sokka + princess Yue arc. You really would need to go over every character and their interactions to see what was missed.\\n\\nAlso they removed/cut very integral scenes - one that sticks out like a sore thumb is the (literally infamous) \\'Yip Yip\\' scene from the animation. I have a hard time believing this wasn\\'t at least filmed and ended up being cut.. This was absent from The Last Airbender live action - but funny enough got a reference in the recent animated series \\'The Dragon Prince\\' having one of the characters jokingly call out \\'Yip Yip\\' in order to get a dragon to fly.. and it works.\\n\\nGiven that I had been looking forward to this show coming out for literally years now I think that also adds to the disappointment, or created unreasonably high expectations.. Maybe not everyone followed so closely, but this show was originally announced in 2018, so from it\\'s announcement took almost 6 years to produce. The longer you have to wait for something the better you expect it to be. Otherwise things come across as \\'overhyped\\' which sadly to say I think the Avatar live action leans towards in my perspective.\\n\\nIt also hints at the next problem with this show.. Although there were strikes and other setbacks like covid during the making of this show - it took a really long time to come out with this first season. Not even renewed for a second season as of writing. So we are looking at quite a wait for a season 2 potentially. I can\\'t exactly blame the show itself for this but I think it compounds the problem of rushing storylines... We wait all this time and you\\'re going to miss stuff and rush through content?\\n\\nDespite the seemingly negative review - I still personally enjoyed it. I doubt I would recommend it to anyone who didn\\'t watch the original cartoons, I don\\'t think it is a good watch for people such as that. I think it provides the nostalgia for those that did watch the cartoon (and probably several run throughs at that). Even given all of that, I am personally looking forward to a potential season 2 still. Given the issues at hand there is still time and possibility to fix the mistakes - I don\\'t have much optimism that will happen, but still gives you something to look forward to.'"

Third (3), characters presented many flaws. Azula weak rather scary/powerful frightening/intimidating.

       " \"Although seemingly high review show negatives positives, feel pretty comfortable rating season 1 7. can't exactly pinpoint redeeming features aside nostalgia towards original animated series huge drawn excitement shows release (which wasn't entirely 100% sabotaged, like live actions). start go like show.. fairly accurate original content, mean didn't totally change re-write things happened. actually immediately much frequently noticed content missing, rather inaccurate revisionist. overall plus me, one worst offenses (in perspective) creating live action show based cartoons, writers start changing things. offensive original creator also egotistical think know better. show wasn't much victim that, not nearly much others. felt true original - not comprehensive whole. bad.. actors, characters bland, dry, didn't really portray cartoon equivalent well all. closest character felt original probably Bumi played relatively small undercut role. later Bumi entire story cut short parts missing (unless yet come, case would chronological order). felt though made characters appealing kids (or PG) removing sense identity likeability. can't really nail specific reasoning, get feeling making characters kid friendly took away sense identity personality. specifically issue Aang, also noticable others Katara Sokka. get sense characters Katara Sakka meant portraying (such Kataras bossiness Sakka's silliness), don't really get desire effect. half hearted best. watching entire series still can't decide exactly say writing problem, directing problem casting problem.. Without spoilers say whole storylines original removed heavily condensed series, guess order make coherent storyline given limited timeframe episodes trying reach certain point story end season. personally think along dry acting two biggest downfalls show. felt tried cover way much Avatar storyline episodes new show. like wanted get much chance won't able make (the show not renewed). don't really understand point this. pretty much ruined storytelling character arcs point. Not seeing certain arcs completely changes way see different characters way feel them. also come 'less real' possible, considering fictional characters. interestingly waste time showing life Aang frozen, never featured original. One place scenes definitely could cut integral storylines cut. think show would better current state, future took things slowly. think season 1 ended somewhere around time southern water tribe attacked, prior whole adventure even unfolding. context - end episode 1. realistically covered think entire season one episode.. Why? thought show wouldn't make end story otherwise? possible reason could have? wouldn't slowing things given job stability future? words, longer could drawn series work longer.. not things happen fast. problem lies whole storylines condensed, removed basically ruined. One part extremely evident compacting story 'blue spirit'. cartoon several interactions Aang finds really is. live action finds way soon ruins entire plot arc. several instances thing, basically every arc worse offenders others sokka + princess Yue arc. really would need go every character interactions see missed. Also removed/cut integral scenes - one sticks like sore thumb (literally infamous) 'Yip Yip' scene animation. hard time believing wasn't least filmed ended cut.. absent Last Airbender live action - funny enough got reference recent animated series 'The Dragon Prince' one characters jokingly call 'Yip Yip' order get dragon fly.. works. Given looking forward show coming literally years think also adds disappointment, created unreasonably high expectations.. Maybe not everyone followed closely, show originally announced 2018, announcement took almost 6 years produce. longer wait something better expect be. Otherwise things come across 'overhyped' sadly say think Avatar live action leans towards perspective. also hints next problem show.. Although strikes setbacks like covid making show - took really long time come first season. Not even renewed second season writing. looking quite wait season 2 potentially. can't exactly blame show think compounds problem rushing storylines... wait time going miss stuff rush content? Despite seemingly negative review - still personally enjoyed it. doubt would recommend anyone didn't watch original cartoons, don't think good watch people that. think provides nostalgia watch cartoon (and probably several run throughs that). Even given that, personally looking forward potential season 2 still. Given issues hand still time possibility fix mistakes - don't much optimism happen, still gives something look forward to.\"]"
